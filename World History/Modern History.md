### **Timeline of the Atherian Empire and its Successors**

1. **Founding of the Atherian Empire (Age of Stars)**:
   - The Atherians begin as a city-state in what is now the Thalmyric Empire.
   - They rapidly expand eastward and westward, driven by their worship of the Star Pantheon and a belief in their celestial destiny.
   - A golden age of conquest begins, with monumental public works, cities, and roads connecting the vast regions of the empire.

2. **Expansion into the West (The Western Conquests)**:
   - The Atherians conquer and colonize the western territories, establishing the provinces that will eventually become Eclessia.
   - Massive cultural diffusion occurs as Atherian language, laws, and religious practices are imposed upon the native peoples.
   - The western provinces remain underdeveloped and rural compared to the eastern heartlands, with tension building between the local aristocracy and the imperial bureaucracy.

3. **The Rise of the Redeemer (The Age of Revelation)**:
   - In the western provinces, a grass-roots religious movement begins, centered around the Redeemer’s teachings.
   - The Redeemer preaches a message of faith, self-sacrifice, and divine love, drawing followers from the lower classes, especially in Eclessia.
   - Over time, the Redeemer travels east, spreading his message and causing friction with the Atherian elite who adhere to the Star Pantheon.

4. **The Crucifixion and Resurrection (The Age of Martyrdom)**:
   - The Redeemer is captured and executed in the capital of the Atherian Empire (now the Thalmyric Empire) due to his growing influence.
   - After his resurrection, his followers are emboldened, and the Faith of the Redeemer spreads rapidly across the empire.
   - A religious schism begins to form, with Eclessia wholeheartedly embracing the new faith, while the east remains more resistant.

5. **Conversion of the Atherian Empire (The Faith Wars)**:
   - After decades of religious persecution and conflict, the entire Atherian Empire eventually adopts the Faith of the Redeemer, abandoning the Star Pantheon.
   - The empire briefly experiences a period of stability, but underlying tensions between east and west grow due to religious, political, and cultural differences.

6. **The Invasion of the Ahl-e-Ahd (The Great Sundering)**:
   - The Ahl-e-Ahd, with their contract-binding magic and powerful armies, begin their invasion from the east, striking at the heart of the Atherian Empire.
   - The emperor calls for all resources and manpower to defend the eastern territories, leaving the western regions under-protected.
   - Banditry, Fäskogarfolk raids, and local uprisings plague the western provinces, leading to their gradual fragmentation.

7. **The Fall of the Atherian Empire (The Interregnum)**:
   - The Atherian Empire collapses as the eastern provinces are overwhelmed by the Ahl-e-Ahd, and the western provinces splinter into independent states.
   - The once-great infrastructure begins to fall into disrepair, and local governments emerge, cutting ties with the imperial seat in the east.
   - The Redeemer's faith, now known as the Eclessian Church, solidifies its power in the west, declaring that whoever can reunite the lands will be divinely blessed to restore the empire.

8. **Rise of the Thalmyric Empire and Eclessian Imperium (The Age of Succession)**:
   - In the east, the Thalmyric Empire rises from the remnants of the Atherian Empire, claiming to be its true successor, while adopting a more mystical version of the Faith of the Redeemer.
   - In the west, the Eclessian Imperium develops as a collection of independent kingdoms, all vying for dominance and the church’s blessing to unify the region.
   - Tensions between Eclessia and Thalmyria grow, with both sides seeing themselves as the true inheritors of the Atherian legacy.

9. **The Reconquest and Holy Wars (The Age of Conflict)**:
   - The Thalmyric Empire focuses on reclaiming lands lost to the Ahl-e-Ahd, framing their military campaigns as holy wars blessed by the Thalmyric Church.
   - Eclessia remains locked in internal conflict, with no single ruler able to claim enough power to reunite the western territories under one banner.
   - The Ahl-e-Ahd continues to be a constant threat, leading to periods of temporary alliances between Eclessia and Thalmyria against a common enemy.
