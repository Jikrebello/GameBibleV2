The religion of the Jirahar is known as the **Path of the Chosen** (or **Ra'adat al-Mukhtarin** in their ancient tongue). It is based on the teachings of the **Great Prophet**, who led them out of captivity and delivered the sacred rituals that dictate their daily lives. The **Path** is both a literal and metaphorical journey, where the faithful follow the ways of their ancestors to remain in harmony with divine will.

### **Founding Story and Sacred History**

The **Path of the Chosen** begins with the story of the **Great Prophet**, who led the original tribe of man out of the lands of captivity in the north, across the **Great Glass Desert** to the southern lands where the rest of humanity now resides. According to Jiraharin tradition, the rest of humanity abandoned the ways of the Great Prophet, becoming corrupted by foreign influences, while the Jirahar remained true to their divine mission.

The **Great Prophet** was said to have received a series of revelations from the divine, which were later compiled into their sacred texts, known as the **Scrolls of the Path**. These revelations provided the laws, rituals, and commandments that the Jirahar follow to this day, and they are seen as **divinely mandated** and unchangeable.

### **Core Beliefs**

#### 1. **The Chosen People**
   - The Jirahar believe they are the **original and chosen people**, uniquely entrusted with preserving the pure ways of the Great Prophet. They view themselves as the last bastion of true humanity, uncorrupted by the ways of outsiders.
   - This chosenness is both a blessing and a burden, as they are tasked with keeping the faith alive through strict observance of the **ritual laws** handed down from their ancestors. Outsiders are considered spiritually impure, and only through **conversion** can they be integrated into the community.

#### 2. **The Law of the Path**
   - The **Law of the Path** dictates every aspect of life, from the most mundane tasks to the most significant religious ceremonies. It governs **how one eats, sleeps, marries, trades, and even thinks**. 
   - Every action must be performed according to **prescribed rituals**, which are believed to align the individual with divine will. For example, the making of tea, the preparation of food, and the setting up of the caravans are all ritualized. Deviating from these practices is seen as a breach of the sacred covenant with the divine.
   
#### 3. **Sacred Rituals and Daily Life**
   - The faithful must follow hundreds of **rituals** throughout the day, starting from morning prayers and ablutions to the rituals governing meals, work, and rest. **Purity** is maintained through these daily acts, and each ritual is seen as a way to remain in spiritual harmony.
   - **Dietary Laws**: The Jirahar follow strict dietary laws, similar to kosher or halal practices, where only specific foods can be consumed, and these must be prepared in precise ways. Eating impure foods or breaking the dietary laws is seen as a significant spiritual failure.
   - **Prayers**: Devout Jirahar pray multiple times a day, facing the direction of the **Great Prophet's homeland** in the north. These prayers are recitations of the **Scrolls of the Path**, reminding them of their obligations and duties.

#### 4. **Purity and the Ritual of Conversion**
   - Only those born into the Jirahar are considered truly pure, but outsiders can **convert** if they fully commit to the rituals and laws. Conversion is a **lengthy process** that requires the individual to undergo rigorous instruction in the laws and practices of the Jirahar. They must renounce their former life and embrace the Path entirely, undergoing a series of **cleansing rituals**.
   - Marriage to outsiders is **forbidden** unless the outsider has undergone this full conversion, making marriage an act of faith as much as a social or familial contract.

#### 5. **The Tower Towns and the Caravans**
   - The **Tower Towns** are seen as **sacred sanctuaries**, places where the laws of the outside world do not apply, and the **Law of the Path** reigns supreme. These towns are the heart of Jirahar life, where the community gathers to perform sacred rites and where the most important religious and legal decisions are made.
   - The **caravans** are mobile sanctuaries, where the faithful continue their journey according to the path laid out by the Great Prophet. The journey itself is seen as a **spiritual act**, reinforcing their nomadic heritage and reminding them that life is a journey of faith.

### **Sacred Texts**

The sacred writings of the Jirahar are compiled in a set of ancient texts known as the **Scrolls of the Path**. These texts contain the full teachings of the Great Prophet, as well as the **ritual laws**, the **histories of the chosen people**, and the **prophecies** about their future.

- **Scroll of Laws**: This scroll contains the comprehensive set of laws that dictate every aspect of life. It is divided into sections that cover daily rituals, trade practices, marriage laws, warfare, and the treatment of outsiders.
- **Scroll of Journeys**: This text tells the story of the Great Prophet's journey through the desert and how the Jirahar were guided to their current way of life. It is seen as a **mythic roadmap** for their own lives.
- **Scroll of Prophecies**: This scroll contains the prophetic visions of the Great Prophet, warning of times when the Jirahar would be tested and promising a future where they would regain their former glory as the rulers of the true lands.

### **Core Practices**

#### 1. **Daily Rituals**
   - The Jiraharâ€™s day is structured around specific times for **prayer**, **purification**, and **ritual acts**. These practices keep the individual and the community in alignment with the divine.
   - **Ritual Cleansing**: Before important actions, such as trading or beginning a journey, individuals must undergo **ritual purification** through prayer and washing. These acts are considered necessary to ensure success and divine favor.
   - **Work and Trade**: Trade is governed by **ritual contracts**, with every exchange formalized through ancient customs. These contracts are seen as more than legal agreements; they are sacred pacts that invoke divine oversight.

#### 2. **Marriage and Family Life**
   - **Marriage** is an act of both spiritual and communal significance, and it is heavily regulated by the laws of the Scrolls. Marriages are arranged through **contracts**, with each family negotiating terms based on their adherence to the rituals and standing within the community.
   - **Polygamy** is permitted but regulated, with strict rules on how additional wives can be taken. Each marriage must be performed according to ritual law, and children are seen as the continuation of the chosen bloodline.
   - **Outsider Marriages**: Marrying an outsider is strictly forbidden unless they convert fully to the Path. Conversion requires a total commitment to the rituals and way of life, and the outsider must renounce all previous cultural ties.

#### 3. **Pilgrimage and Festivals**
   - The Jirahar are expected to make **pilgrimages** to the sacred sites of their ancestors, particularly the **Towers of the North**, where the Great Prophet is said to have first received his divine revelation. These pilgrimages are major communal events, with entire caravans making the journey together.
   - **Festivals**: The Jirahar celebrate **festivals** tied to the seasons, their nomadic life, and key events from their sacred texts. These festivals are times of **ritual feasting**, trade, and the renewal of sacred contracts within the community.

#### 4. **Conversion and Outsider Relations**
   - Outsiders are seen as spiritually impure, and the **conversion process** is rigorous. Converts must study the **Scrolls of the Path** for years, learn the rituals, and demonstrate their commitment by undergoing a series of **cleansing rituals** and public oaths. Only after completing this process are they allowed to marry within the community or become full members.

### **Leadership and Religious Authority**

The Jirahar are governed by a council of religious leaders known as the **Keepers of the Scrolls**, who are responsible for interpreting the laws and ensuring that the community remains faithful to the Path. 

- **The Keepers of the Scrolls**: These elders are scholars of the sacred texts, responsible for leading religious ceremonies, overseeing conversions, and settling disputes according to the law.
- **Ritual Leaders**: Each caravan and Tower Town has its own **Ritual Leaders** who ensure that daily rituals are observed and who lead the community in prayer and festivals.
- **The High Priest of the Path**: The ultimate religious authority is the **High Priest**, who resides in the most sacred of the Tower Towns and serves as the final arbiter of religious law and practice.
