### **The Jirahar Version of the Monomyth: "The Path of the Chosen"**

The **Jirahar** hold a unique interpretation of the **Great Exodus** myth, which they call **"The Path of the Chosen"** or **"Ra'adat al-Mukhtarin"**. In their tradition, the Great Exodus is more than just a historical event; it is the central **spiritual journey** that defines their identity as the **Chosen People**, entrusted with preserving the true teachings of the **Great Prophet** and maintaining the sacred **Path** handed down through the ages.

#### **1. The Creation of Humanity and the Fall**

In the beginning, the **Jirahar** believe, the world was crafted by the **One Above All**, the Lord, and humanity was created as **His chosen people**, destined to walk the **Path of Truth** in harmony with the divine. The **Scroll of Creation**, part of the **Scrolls of the Path**, teaches that humanity was endowed with divine purpose and set apart from all other beings. Humanity was meant to live according to the **Law of the Path**, a set of divine principles revealed directly to them by the One Above All.

However, **Shaytan**, the **Deceiver**, grew jealous of humanity's favored position and sought to lead them astray. Through cunning whispers, Shaytan convinced the first humans to abandon the Path and follow their own desires. In doing so, they broke their **Covenant with the Lord** and fell from grace. The **First Betrayal** caused humanity to be cast out of the lands of **Light**, and the world became a place of **trial** and **testing**, where both good and evil now coexisted.

The **Idols** and the **Menhir**, fallen beings who once served the Lord, took advantage of this fall and established their own domains of power. These entities bound themselves to the natural world and the realms of the **Dreamlands**, and they, too, led humanity into deeper error, corrupting them through false worship and twisted teachings. The **Giants**, children of the Idols and Menhir, enslaved humanity, binding them to servitude through false pacts and promises.

#### **2. The Bondage Under the Giants**

The Jirahar’s version of the **Bondage Under the Giants** is one of the most detailed in their sacred texts. It is said that, after humanity fell from grace, they were scattered across the northern lands, where the Giants reigned supreme. These Giants, known to the Jirahar as the **Mamalik al-Jababira** (Lords of the Giants), ruled over vast empires, each more decadent and cruel than the last.

- The **Jababira of Qanglun**, the iron-fisted rulers of the mountains, demanded the people toil endlessly in the frozen fields, offering their lives as sacrifices to feed the empire’s war machine.
- The **Jababira of Ishkar**, the serpent-like rulers of the river, bound the people in chains of gold, enslaving them through contracts of wealth and debt.
- The **Jababira of Xulat**, the obsidian giants of the jungle, demanded blood sacrifices, turning the people into little more than cattle for their insatiable thirst for power.
- The **Jababira of Nythalum**, the machine-giants, enslaved humanity through promises of progress and enlightenment, only to bind them to soulless machines that fed their quest for celestial domination.

In this era of bondage, humanity suffered greatly. According to the **Scroll of the Bonds**, the Jirahar ancestors lived as slaves, their bodies broken by toil and their spirits crushed under the false gods who demanded their worship. The Jirahar’s telling emphasizes that it was not just the physical chains that enslaved their people but also the **spiritual chains** that bound them to the corrupt idols and giants.

#### **3. The Coming of the Great Prophet: "Al-Mukhtar al-Khalas"**

Amid this suffering, the Lord had mercy on His people and chose a prophet to lead them out of bondage. The **Great Prophet**, known as **Al-Mukhtar al-Khalas** (The Chosen One of Salvation), was chosen not just to deliver them from physical slavery but to restore the **Law of the Path**, which had been forgotten by most of humanity.

Al-Mukhtar al-Khalas was raised in secret by a small remnant of the faithful, those who had never fully given in to the worship of the Giants and their idols. He was taught the sacred laws of the **Scroll of the Path**, and as he grew, he began to hear the voice of the **One Above All**. The Lord instructed him to rise up and lead His people across the lands of the Giants, freeing them from their bonds and teaching them the true Path.

The Great Prophet traveled through the lands of the Giants, performing miracles and calling the people to repentance. In each empire, he faced great resistance from the Giants, who feared his divine power. However, through the strength of the Lord, Al-Mukhtar al-Khalas unleashed divine **Plagues** upon the Giants, breaking their hold over the people and leading many to follow him.

- In **Qanglun**, the Prophet caused the **Mountains to Fall**, destroying the fortresses of the warlords and allowing the people to escape their iron grip.
- In **Ishkar**, the Prophet **turned gold to sand**, breaking the chains of wealth that enslaved the people and bringing famine to the serpent empire.
- In **Xulat**, the Prophet caused **volcanic eruptions**, destroying the altars of blood and bringing down the obsidian giants.
- In **Nythalum**, the Prophet **shattered the machines**, breaking the connection between the giants and the heavens, causing their spires to crumble and their machines to fail.

As he moved through the lands, more and more people joined the Prophet’s cause, leaving behind the Giants and their false gods. The Prophet taught them the **Law of the Path**, and they became the **Chosen People**—those entrusted with the sacred task of preserving the true teachings of the Lord.

#### **4. The Crossing of the Great Glass Desert**

After freeing the people from the Giants, the Great Prophet led them into the **Great Glass Desert**, a vast and treacherous expanse of shimmering sands and hidden dangers. The desert was both a physical trial and a spiritual purification, where the people were tested in their faith and devotion to the Lord.

According to the **Scroll of Journeys**, the Prophet guided his people through the desert by day and night, using divine light to show the way. He taught them the rituals and laws that would keep them pure, warning them against falling back into the idolatry of the Giants. The desert became a place of renewal, where the people shed the last remnants of their past lives and embraced the **Path of the Chosen** fully.

#### **5. The Final Test and the Death of the Prophet**

As the people neared the southern edge of the desert, the Great Prophet received a final command from the Lord: they were to stop and build a great city, a **Sanctuary of the Faithful**, where they would dwell for three generations. This city would be a place of learning and worship, where the people could grow strong in the faith before entering the promised land.

However, Al-Mukhtar al-Khalas, fearing that staying in one place would lead the people to grow complacent and fall back into idolatry, disobeyed the Lord's command. He pressed on, urging his followers to continue toward the promised land. In response to this act of disobedience, the Lord sent a great storm, a **Rage of the Heavens**, that swept across the desert.

The Prophet was caught in the storm and was taken from the people. His body was never found, and the storm raged for days, scattering the people across the desert.

#### **6. The Division of the Peoples and the Remnant of the Faithful**

With the death of the Prophet, the people were left without a common leader or vision. Some continued on their journey, each group following its own interpretation of the Prophet’s teachings. These groups eventually became the various peoples and cultures of the southern lands. Most of these groups, however, forgot the true teachings of the Great Prophet, falling back into idol worship and adopting the customs of the lands they settled in.

Only a small remnant, known as the **Jirahar**, remained true to the Path. These faithful followers believed that they had not yet reached the promised land and chose to live as **nomads**, traveling from place to place, always seeking the fulfillment of the divine promise. They refused to settle in one place, knowing that their journey was both physical and spiritual, a continuous quest to remain in harmony with the divine will.

The Jirahar established the tradition of the **Tower Towns** and **Caravans**, moving from place to place and maintaining their ancient rituals. The **Path of the Chosen** became not just a religious belief but a way of life, where every action, from eating to traveling, was seen as a sacred act of worship.

#### **7. The Legacy of the Prophet and the Eternal Journey**

The Jirahar still follow the teachings of the Great Prophet, as recorded in the **Scrolls of the Path**, believing themselves to be the last true keepers of the divine law. They maintain that they are the **Chosen People**, entrusted with preserving the original faith and guiding humanity back to the Lord.

The Great Exodus, in their eyes, was not just a historical event but an ongoing spiritual journey. They believe that, one day, the **True Promised Land** will be revealed to them, and they will finally fulfill their divine destiny as the guardians

 of the Lord's will.

Until that day, the Jirahar continue to walk the Path, ever mindful of their role as the faithful remnant, dedicated to the teachings of the Great Prophet and the preservation of the divine order.

This version of the monomyth reflects the Jirahar's identity as a nomadic, chosen people, bound by ancient laws and traditions. It emphasizes their spiritual journey, their belief in being the last true followers of the Great Prophet, and their enduring commitment to the **Path of the Chosen**.
