The  region known as **Eclessia** is a vast collection of kingdoms and territories that were all in some way, shape or form once apart of the Atherian Empire before its withdrawal back to the east. It is the origin spot for the Eclessian church and the faith of the **Redeemer** and his teachings is particular strong here, all the way from the peasentry to its nobles and rulers. As a beacon of religious authority and spiritual guidance, it is structured much like medieval Christendom, with strong ties between the church, nobility, and knightly orders. Eclessia is shaped by a deep connection to the Redeemer’s doctrine of faith, self-sacrifice, and divine love, which is contrasted against the remnants of the **Atherian Empire** of old, from which it originally came from. However, it is also currently suffering from an interregnum, with no clear kingdom or ruler able to get a strong enough advantage or collection of alliances to fulfil the churches mandate to once again bring back and rule a second Atherian Empire.

### **Historical Context**

Eclessia is the name given to the collection of provinces that all make up the western part of the fallen **Atherian Empire**. It was settled after years of conquest and expansion, and as a result is much more rough, rural and underdeveloped compared to the Thalmyric Empire. The region became destabilized and fell into an interregnum after the Atherian Empire collapsed trying to defend its eastern lands and holdings against the Ahl-e-Ahd and their aggressive expansion into the cultural heartlands of the empire, essentially leaving large swarths of the empire in the west high and dry. This lead to mass banditry and the barbarian Fäskogarfolk to start invading and taking over the land so hard fought for in years past by the Atherians.

The faith of the Redeemer first started in this part of the world, as it was the more underdeveloped and "backwards" part of the Atherian Empire, and as such, spread much more easily and with far less resistance than it would've received if it had started in the Atherian heartlands. It was here that after the Redeemers death, with much resistance and subjugation, the faith was able to establish itself and become recognized and surpass the faith of the Star Children, and eventually after much time converting the entire Atherian Empire to the faith of the Redeemer, with the **Sanctum Divinitatis** being established in the Kingdom of Aurelia, which become the new political/ religious and administrative centre for the western part of the Atherian Empire. However, this newly unified Atherian Empire with its faith under the church of the Redeemer was short lived, as the invasion of the Ahl-e-Ahd into the Atherians eastern part of the empire soon lead to the western part of the empire experiencing massive withdraw of resources and people, as the eastern part pulled all resources to fight off against the oncoming invasion. This lead to the western part of the empire basically falling apart, with most regions outside of the most heavily fortified cities and territories falling to bandit raids and Enaidfae raids and incursions. This carried on for a quite a long time, and eventually the Ecelssian church declaring that whoever could restore the west would be divinely mandated as the new and rightful ruler, with the church giving its blessing and authority.

The Eclessian Church claims to be the rightful successor of the Atherian legacy through divine mandate.

However, it is locked in a longstanding rivalry with the **Thalmyric Empire**, which also claims succession from the Atherians. The Thalmyric faith follows the same Redeemer’s path, yet its **Eastern Church** has diverged, adopting more mystical, contemplative practices in contrast to the Eclessian Imperium’s more structured and worldly church.

### **Religion: The Path of the Redeemer**

The Path of the Redeemer is the spiritual foundation of the Eclessian Church, guiding the lives of its citizens through a blend of religious doctrine, daily worship, and the veneration of saints.

#### **Core Beliefs**
1. **The Lord and the Redeemer**: The **Lord** is the supreme deity, depicted as a being of light and purity, often symbolized by the **phoenix**, a creature of resurrection and divine transformation. The Redeemer was the Lord’s mortal incarnation, sent to lead humanity away from the darkness of the **Adversary** and the **Menhir** (the old Star Children) and into the light of divine love.
   
2. **Saints and Miracles**: Over the centuries, the church has canonized mortals who displayed exceptional faith and performed divine miracles. These saints are intermediaries between the faithful and the Lord, often depicted with angelic, bird-like features such as wings or talon-like hands.

3. **Divine Will and Free Will**: The Eclessian Church teaches that while the **Lord’s will** governs the universe, humans have free will to choose their path. Those who align with the Lord through faith and love are rewarded, while those who succumb to the Adversary fall into darkness.

4. **Scholasticism**: Intellectual and theological study is central to the faith. Monks, theologians, and scholars study divine texts, natural philosophy, and the arts as a means of honoring the Lord. This pursuit of knowledge is similar to the **Carolingian Renaissance**, with the belief that reason and faith are deeply connected.

### **Worship and Practices**

- **Daily Prayer and Devotions**: Eclessians engage in prayer several times a day, often at home or in elaborately adorned churches, which feature **mosaics** and **stained glass** depicting saints, the Redeemer, and divine symbols.
  
- **Pilgrimages**: Pilgrimages to sacred sites, including shrines of saints or places where the Redeemer performed miracles, are acts of devotion believed to offer spiritual cleansing and divine favor.

- **Charity and Service**: The faith stresses the importance of charity, healing the sick, and protecting the weak. Service to others is seen as the highest expression of love for the Redeemer.

### **Political and Social Structure**

The **Church of the Redeemer** is a significant part of the Eclessia's political and social structure, with the kingdom of Aurelia and its semi autonomous duchies of Veridancia  and Caldria being a theocratic government that blends religious doctrine with temporal power. The other kingdoms in the Eclessian region, whilst autonomous, make sure to consider the Churches authority as it provides essential goods and services as well as having significant sway over the general populace and the peasentry.  

#### **The High Council of the Redeemer**
The **High Council** is the highest authority in the Eclessian Church, overseeing religious law, doctrine, and governance. Made up of religious leaders, it advises the ruling nobilities of all kingdoms in the region, ensuring that decisions align with the Redeemer’s teachings.

#### **Noble and Knightly Influence**
Noble families hold significant power in Eclessia and its kingdoms, and are often tied to the church through their patronage of religious institutions. Knightly orders and paladins serve as protectors of the faith, defending the faith and their kingdoms and participating in crusades against heresy or foreign threats.
