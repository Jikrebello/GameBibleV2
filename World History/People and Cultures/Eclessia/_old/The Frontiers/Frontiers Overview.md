### **The Frontier Realms**

The **Frontier Realms** are a group of territories that lie on the fringes of Eclessia. These lands are thoroughly **independent** and not officially part of the church, but they share historical ties due to **settlement** and **colonization** by Atherian Empire citizens in the past. While the **church** holds little direct political power in these regions, there is a **grassroots level** of religious influence that has mixed with the local **pagan traditions**, creating strange **syncretisms**. 

The people of these regions, though free from direct church oversight, are still culturally linked to the church and Eclessia, and their traditions reflect a blend of **colonial heritage** and **local beliefs**.

The Sylvan Marches are influential due to their **elite ranger corps**, who are unmatched in their ability to **navigate and defend the wilderness**.
