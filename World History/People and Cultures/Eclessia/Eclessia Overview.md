Eclessia is a sprawling, fractured region that was once a vital part of the mighty **Atherian Empire**. Today, it stands as a collection of independent kingdoms, duchies, and provinces loosely united by the powerful influence of the **Eclessian Church**. The church is the dominant authority in Eclessia, shaping its politics, culture, and social life, but the region has yet to be fully unified under a single ruler since the collapse of the Atherian Empire.

Once the western frontier of the Atherian Empire, Eclessia has become a land of rich history, deep religious devotion, and constant political intrigue. Although it is more rural and underdeveloped compared to the **Thalmyric Empire** in the east, Eclessia is home to devout followers of the **Faith of the Redeemer**, whose teachings continue to guide its people.

### **Historical Context**

Eclessia was once a frontier region of the **Atherian Empire**, filled with scattered tribes and rural communities. It was one of the last regions to be fully integrated into the empire, with the imperial heartland located far to the east. Though lacking the same level of urban development as the Atherian heartlands, Eclessia was gradually shaped by the empire’s cultural, religious, and infrastructural influence.

However, the rise of the **Redeemer** occurred in this very region, giving it a unique historical significance. The Redeemer's message of divine love, redemption, and salvation resonated with the rural population, particularly in regions neglected by the Atherian elite. Over time, his followers grew in number, and after the Redeemer's death and resurrection, the **Faith of the Redeemer** rapidly spread throughout Eclessia, becoming the dominant religion and replacing the old Atherian worship of the **Star Pantheon**.

Eclessia's growing spiritual importance was cemented with the establishment of the **Sanctum Divinitatis** in the Kingdom of **Aurelia**, which became the spiritual and administrative heart of the **Eclessian Church**. However, when the **Ahl-e-Ahd** invaded the Atherian Empire from the east, the empire shifted all of its resources and manpower eastward to halt the invasion, leading to the collapse of imperial control in the west. This left Eclessia in a state of chaos, with local rulers declaring autonomy to defend their lands against the ensuing anarchy, banditry, and invasions from the **Fäskogarfolk** and other tribes.

Today, Eclessia is a land of **religious fervor**, **rural strength**, and **political disunity**. The **Sanctum Divinitatis** in **Aurelia** serves as the region’s spiritual compass, but without a central ruler to unite the fractured kingdoms and duchies, Eclessia remains a region of fierce competition, noble ambition, and divine mandate.

### **Religion: The Faith of the Redeemer**

The **Faith of the Redeemer** is the foundation of Eclessia’s identity, binding the region together despite its political fragmentation. Every aspect of life is shaped by devotion to the **Lord**, whose mortal incarnation as the Redeemer represents the ultimate sacrifice for humanity’s salvation. 

#### **Core Beliefs**

1. **The Lord and the Redeemer**: Eclessians believe in the **Lord**, the supreme deity who created the universe and sent the **Redeemer** to guide humanity toward salvation. The Redeemer’s mortal life, death, and resurrection are seen as the ultimate acts of divine love and redemption.

2. **Divine Mandate**: The **Sanctum Divinitatis** declares that the Redeemer’s teachings are the guiding force of humanity. The faithful believe that the **Lord’s will** is revealed through signs, miracles, and visions, and that true rulers must have the church’s blessing to claim their thrones.

3. **Saints and Martyrs**: Over the centuries, numerous **saints** and **martyrs** have been canonized by the church for their acts of piety, miracles, or sacrifice. These saints serve as intermediaries between the faithful and the Lord, and their relics are venerated across the region.

4. **The Adversary**: The **Adversary** is the ultimate representation of evil in Eclessian doctrine, standing in opposition to the Lord. The **Star Pantheon** and the **Menhir** (old gods such as **Trium** and the **Star Children**) are considered false idols or agents of the Adversary, whose worship is heretical and dangerous.

#### **Church Structure and Influence**

The **Eclessian Church** is a powerful institution, governing not only spiritual life but also exerting great influence over politics and society. It is ruled by the **High Council of the Redeemer**, headquartered in the city of **Aurelia**. This council of high priests and bishops ensures that doctrine is followed across Eclessia and maintains the church’s moral authority.

- **High Council of the Redeemer**: The highest religious body in Eclessia, the **High Council** is responsible for interpreting divine will, approving religious and political leaders, and overseeing the spiritual welfare of the region. It is located in **Aurelia** at the **Sanctum Divinitatis**.

- **Priests and Bishops**: Every kingdom and duchy in Eclessia has its own network of churches and priests who guide their congregations in prayer, perform religious ceremonies, and oversee local governance in matters of faith.

- **Knightly Orders**: Various **knightly orders**, dedicated to the Redeemer’s teachings, serve as defenders of the faith and protectors of the realm. These orders are a key part of the political landscape, often acting as military forces for the church and enforcers of divine justice.

- **Festivals and Holy Days**: The region celebrates numerous religious festivals, marking important moments in the Redeemer’s life as well as significant celestial events interpreted as omens from the Lord. These festivals involve processions, offerings, and public prayers.

- **Pilgrimage**: Pilgrimages to sacred sites, such as the **Shrine of the Redeemer** in Aurelia or the **holy tombs of saints**, are seen as acts of devotion that bring the faithful closer to the divine.

- **Crusades and Holy Wars**: The **Eclessian Church** frequently calls for **crusades** against heretics, pagans, and foreign invaders, such as the **Ahl-e-Ahd** or **Fäskogarfolk**. These campaigns are seen as holy duties to cleanse the world of the Adversary’s influence.

### **Political and Social Structure**

Eclessia is a **feudal society**, with a deeply intertwined relationship between the church and the nobility. While the **Sanctum Divinitatis** holds significant religious authority, individual kingdoms and duchies maintain their own political sovereignty. However, the **interregnum** following the fall of the Atherian Empire has led to fierce competition among noble families, each vying for the church’s favor and the chance to reunify the region under a single ruler.

#### **Noble Families and Kingdoms**

Eclessia is divided into numerous kingdoms, duchies, and smaller lordships, all ruled by noble families who claim descent from the Atherian Empire’s former governors and generals. These families control vast estates, armies, and resources, but none have yet succeeded in uniting Eclessia.

- **Kingdom of Aurelia**: The spiritual heart of Eclessia and home to the **Sanctum Divinitatis**, **Aurelia** is a theocratic kingdom ruled jointly by the church and the monarchy. Its capital is the center of religious and political power.

- **Duchy of Veridancia**: A wealthy and fertile region known for its vineyards and diplomacy. The **Veridancian** nobility are skilled negotiators, often serving as mediators between rival factions within Eclessia.

- **Duchy of Caldria**: A land known for its military tradition, home to elite knights and paladins. The **Caldrian knights** are renowned for their discipline and devotion to the Redeemer, often leading crusades or acting as the church’s enforcers.

#### **Knightly Orders**

The **knightly orders** of Eclessia play a critical role in both religious and military life. These orders are sworn to uphold the Redeemer’s teachings and often serve as protectors of the faithful, acting as a military force for the church.

- **The Order of the Phoenix**: Based in **Aurelia**, the **Order of the Phoenix** is one of the most prestigious knightly orders in Eclessia. Its members are devout warriors who see themselves as instruments of the Redeemer’s will, dedicated to eradicating heresy and defending the church.

- **The Silver Wing**: A smaller but elite knightly order based in **Caldria**, known for its aerial cavalry and griffon riders. They are deployed in crusades against the Fäskogarfolk and in defense of the western borders.

#### **The Role of the Church**

The **Eclessian Church** holds immense power, and no noble family can claim legitimacy without its blessing. In many cases, the church acts as a mediator, controlling key resources and directing the loyalty of the peasantry. It also serves as the primary source of education and moral authority.

- **Peasant Life**: The vast majority of Eclessians are farmers, laborers, or craftsmen, whose lives revolve around the church’s teachings. They owe allegiance to their local lords, but their spiritual loyalty lies with the Redeemer.
