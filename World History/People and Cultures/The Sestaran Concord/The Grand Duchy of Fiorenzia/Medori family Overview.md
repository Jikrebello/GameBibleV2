The **Medori family** is one of the most powerful and influential families in the **Sestaran Concord** and beyond. They are the founding rulers of the **Grand Duchy of Fiorenzia**, and their vast wealth, accumulated through their control of the **Medori Bank**, has made them one of the most formidable forces in both the financial and political arenas of the known world. Publicly, the family is known for its **patronage of the arts**, intellectual contributions, and savvy financial dealings. However, beneath this polished surface lies a darker history of **hidden magic**, **ancient secrets**, and manipulation.

At the center of the Medori family's power is their mastery of both **mundane** and **arcane contracts**—a practice they inherited from their **Ahl-e-Ahd lineage**, which they have kept hidden for centuries. This secret, combined with their strategic brilliance, has allowed them to rise to power during the height of the **Atherian Empire** and maintain dominance in the current age.

### **Origins of the Medori Family**

The Medori family traces its origins back to the ancient **Ahl-e-Ahd Empire**, where they were once a prominent and noble house. Known for their mastery of **contract-binding magic**, the family fell into ruin following a catastrophic political scandal and fled to the **Sestaran Peninsula**. Over time, they leveraged their legal expertise, financial acumen, and hidden magical talents to rise to prominence in **Fiorenzia** during the later years of the **Atherian Empire**.

To survive under the **Atherian regime**, which banned **Ahl-e-Ahd magic** and viewed it as sorcery tied to the **Adversary**, the Medori family perfected the art of using **mundane contracts** and **legal subterfuge**. The family used their financial power to influence imperial courts and noble houses, all while secretly preserving their arcane knowledge. Their success culminated in the establishment of the **Medori Bank**, which quickly grew into the most powerful financial institution in the known world.

### **Public Persona vs. Hidden Truth**

Publicly, the Medori family presents itself as the **epitome of Fiorenzian refinement**—patrons of the arts, literature, and philosophy. They are seen as **visionaries** who helped shape Fiorenzia into a center of culture and intellect, with the **Fiorenzian Academy** standing as a testament to their influence.

However, the **true power** of the Medori family lies in their ability to manipulate behind the scenes. They are **master manipulators**, orchestrating political, financial, and military schemes across both **Eclessia** and **Thalmyria**. The family uses its **vast wealth** to fund multiple factions, ensuring that no single power can rise to challenge their dominance. The Medori Bank’s role in **loaning funds to kings**, **financing wars**, and **supporting both sides** of conflicts ensures that the family remains indispensable, while also perpetuating the instability that benefits their business.

### **Ahl-e-Ahd Lineage and Contract Magic**

What the world does not know is that the Medori family’s rise to power is deeply rooted in their **Ahl-e-Ahd heritage** and mastery of **contract magic**. This ancient art allows them to create **binding agreements** that transcend mere paper, involving **magical pacts** that can seal one’s **life force**, **memory**, or even **soul** in exchange for services or wealth.

While they largely rely on **mundane contracts** for day-to-day operations, the Medori family still employs their **arcane magic** for the most sensitive and high-stakes deals. These contracts, often performed in secret, bind powerful individuals, mercenaries, and rivals to the family’s will. This magic is particularly evident in their control of the **Debtors’ Corps**, where **magical debt contracts** force elite individuals into service.

Due to the stigma surrounding **Ahl-e-Ahd sorcery**, the family goes to great lengths to ensure that their **arcane abilities** remain hidden, revealing this part of their heritage only to trusted family members.
