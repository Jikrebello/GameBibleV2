### **Formation and Recruitment**

The Debtors’ Corps is made up of individuals from a wide variety of backgrounds, all of whom share one thing in common: they owe the **Medori Bank** an **insurmountable debt**. This debt could be financial in nature, the result of a **failed business venture**, a **personal loan gone awry**, or even a **framed incident** that led to the debt being forcibly imposed.
