### **Overview**

The **Sermoran Republic** is a naval powerhouse, a republic built on the foundations of **trade**, **mercenary fleets**, and **piracy**. Located in the **Sermoran Isles**, a strategic and sprawling archipelago of islands rich with fortifications, hidden coves, and bustling canal cities, Sermora has become the undisputed **naval and mercantile leader** in the region. Though the republic presents itself as a beacon of **commerce** and **culture**, it thrives on **privateering**, **mercenary warfare**, and **political intrigue**.

Sermora is a city of **canals**, a maze of waterways connecting the city’s districts and markets. Grand **merchant houses**, **pirate enclaves**, and **fortresses** dominate its landscape, while the **Admiralty Council**—a coalition of **merchant lords**, **mercenary captains**, and **spymasters**—secretly controls the wealth and power of the republic. The **Doge**, the elected ruler, oversees the balance of power between these factions, serving as a public figurehead, though true authority resides within the council.

The Sermoran Republic’s wealth flows from its control over key **trade routes**, its dominance in the **luxury goods market**, and its **privateering operations** that secretly plunder rival ships. Sermoran **mercenary fleets** are hired out to city-states and empires across the Concord, waging naval warfare on behalf of their patrons while enriching the republic's coffers. Yet beneath its gleaming facade of diplomacy and commerce, **espionage** plays a key role in Sermora’s influence, with **spies**, **informants**, and **assassins** controlling much of the region’s political landscape.

### **Key Features**

#### **1. Merchant Empire and Privateering**

Sermora’s **merchant fleets** and **trade routes** dominate the Thalassian Sea, driving a flourishing economy of **luxury goods** such as **spices**, **silks**, **rare gems**, and **exotic imports** from distant lands. **Merchant families**, some of the wealthiest in the world, sponsor fleets of **privateers**—pirates who raid enemy ships and return plunder to the republic’s markets under the guise of legitimate operations.

These **privateers** are a key asset to the republic, enriching its coffers and providing the **Admiralty Council** with a steady flow of gold. However, they also serve as a tool of **diplomatic warfare**, attacking the trade routes of rivals under secret orders while maintaining plausible deniability.

- **Pirate Havens**: Many of the smaller, hidden islands of the Sermoran Isles serve as sanctuaries for pirates and privateers. Here, pirate lords refit their ships, trade their plunder, and conduct shady business under the protection of the republic’s merchant elite.
- **Merchant Lords**: The wealthy **merchant families** who control Sermora’s trade dominate the **Admiralty Council**, using their riches to fund mercenary operations and private fleets. Their power lies in **cutthroat business practices** and a network of spies that ensure their supremacy.

#### **2. Espionage and Intrigue**

Beneath the thriving commerce of Sermora lies a city steeped in **espionage**. The **Council of Ten**, a shadowy group of spymasters, controls a vast network of **agents**, **informants**, and **assassins** spread throughout the Thalassian Sea and beyond. These agents manipulate **political events**, sabotage rival powers, and ensure that no threat to Sermora remains hidden for long.

Espionage is an integral part of the republic’s power structure.
