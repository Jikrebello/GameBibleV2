### **External Power Dynamics**
**1. House Verati (Formerly of Aversia)**

- **Status**: Extinct (Publicly) but with rumored surviving members
- **Background**: House Verati was one of the most powerful noble families in Aversia before the **Soran takeover**. They controlled large swaths of the city's steelworks and had a long history of wealth and influence. Their downfall came during the Soran manipulation of the civil war, which resulted in **mass executions** of Verati family members.
- **Rivalry**: Though House Verati was publicly **destroyed** by the Sorans, rumors persist that some **surviving members** live in exile, working to undermine the Soran rule. There are whispers of Verati agents in rival city-states or working covertly in Aversia to **restore** their fallen house. House Soran keeps a watchful eye on potential Verati resurgence and possible sympathizers within Aversia’s populace.

**2. House Carvonius (Formerly of Aversia)**

- **Status**: Destroyed (Officially), but like House Verati, rumors of survivors abound
- **Background**: The **Carvonius family** was another old, established house in Aversia, controlling vast iron mines and maintaining significant influence before their destruction during the civil war. They were wealthy, proud, and highly conservative, deeply embedded in Aversia’s traditional structures.
- **Rivalry**: Like House Verati, they were **crushed by the Sorans**, and public executions ensured that House Carvonius’ name was wiped from official records. However, rumors of surviving Carvonius descendants living in other cities and **plotting revenge** against the Sorans are prevalent. Any Carvonius presence is deeply secretive and poses a **potential threat** to the Soran dynasty.

**3. House Bellaris (From the City-State of Fiorenzia)**

- **Status**: Rival Family (Ongoing)
- **Background**: House Bellaris is one of the most established and wealthy families in the **Grand Duchy of Fiorenzia**, known for its involvement in **art, culture, and banking**. The Bellaris family holds close ties with the **Medori family** and sees itself as an elite power in the region.
- **Rivalry**: The Bellaris family views the **Soran rise to power** as vulgar and sees them as **upstarts** with no real noble pedigree. The rivalry between House Bellaris and House Soran is **both social and political**, as the Bellaris family works to **undermine Soran influence** within the Concord. They use their considerable wealth to **block trade deals** involving Aversian steel and weaponry, attempting to keep Soran power in check. The Bellaris also work covertly to support factions that could challenge the Sorans in the future, perhaps even backing **mercenary groups** or dissenters in Aversia itself.

**4. House Valorian (From the Republic of Viscara)**

- **Status**: Strategic Rivalry
- **Background**: House Valorian is a wealthy and powerful merchant family in **Viscara**, known for its control over **trade routes** and its **naval strength**. Their wealth stems from their **dominance over the seas**, and they have built vast fortunes through **shipping and maritime commerce**.
- **Rivalry**: House Valorian and the Sorans are often **at odds** over the control of **trade routes**, with the Valorians pushing for dominance over **maritime trade**, while the Sorans aim to **secure land-based supply chains** for their iron and steel exports. The two houses often find themselves in **commercial competition**, though neither has directly challenged the other militarily. Both families are pragmatic and understand the importance of mutual interests, so while the rivalry exists, they sometimes engage in **pragmatic alliances** when their goals overlap, such as during negotiations over military contracts or weapons shipments.

**5. House Medori (From the Grand Duchy of Fiorenzia)**

- **Status**: Cautious Partnership and Rivalry
- **Background**: The **Medori family**, with its control over the **Medori Bank**, has immense financial influence throughout the Concord and beyond. They maintain **ties with nearly every ruling house** in the region, including House Soran, through their loans and financial backing.
- **Rivalry**: While House Medori and House Soran maintain a **pragmatic alliance**, especially when it comes to financial matters, there is underlying tension between them. The Medoris view the Sorans as **military brutes**, useful for securing financial interests but potentially dangerous if they grow too powerful. For their part, the Sorans are wary of being **too financially dependent** on Medori loans and prefer to keep the relationship as **transactional** as possible. Despite these tensions, the Medori Bank frequently finances **Soran mercenary contracts** and military campaigns, and Duke Marcus Soran has been known to use Medori connections to **fund his ambitions** both inside and outside Aversia.

### **Internal Power Dynamics**

**1. Tensions Between Marcus and Valerius II Soran**

While **Marcus Soran** leads with a firm hand, his younger brother **Valerius II** harbors a **quiet ambition**. As the **Master of Contracts**, Valerius has built strong ties with **foreign powers** through the **mercenary business**, and there are whispers that he may one day seek to carve out his own power base, either within Aversia or beyond its borders.

Valerius’s **close ties** to the **mercenary captains** and his control over the **steelworks** have allowed him to amass considerable wealth and influence within the Soran structure. While he is publicly loyal to his brother, there is a growing sense that **Valerius is playing a long game**, building alliances outside the family that may one day challenge Marcus’s position as Duke. Marcus, being ever-calculating, likely keeps his brother on a short leash, aware of the growing tension but unwilling to act until Valerius makes a decisive move.

**2. Aurelia Soran’s Military Control**

**Aurelia Soran**, as the **General of the Aversian Army**, wields considerable power within the **military apparatus**. Her loyalty to Marcus is unquestionable, but her **militaristic vision** sometimes puts her at odds with her brother’s more **politically cautious** approach. Aurelia believes in **military conquest** and is always pushing for **aggressive expansion**, which Marcus sometimes tempers in favor of **strategic diplomacy**.

There is also the potential for **conflict** between **Aurelia and Valerius II**, as they represent two very different arms of the Soran power structure. Aurelia controls the standing army, while Valerius II manages the **mercenary forces**. Should tensions between the siblings grow, this could become a **flashpoint** within the family, especially if Valerius II begins to **assert his influence** over Aversian mercenary forces at Aurelia’s expense.

**3. Octavia Soran’s Web of Espionage**

**Octavia Soran**, the family’s **spy master** and **diplomat**, operates largely in the shadows, maintaining a **network of spies** both in Aversia and abroad. She uses this network to keep tabs on the **rival houses**, as well as her own family. While outwardly loyal to Marcus, Octavia is known to be highly **ambitious**, and she works constantly to **expand her influence** through both **covert manipulation** and **diplomatic channels**.

Octavia’s ambitions may eventually place her at odds with her family memebers, especially **Valerius II**, whose **mercenary dealings** often overlap with her **covert operations**. She is skilled at playing different factions against one another, but the family are aware of her **potential duplicity**. As such, they remain cautious around her, knowing she is capable of maneuvering them into positions that serve her own interests.

### **Conclusion**

The **House of Soran** is defined by its **mercenary origins**, its **military might**, and its **strategic manipulation** of both internal and external forces. Despite their rise to power, they remain **ruthless**, always seeking to **strengthen their hold** on Aversia while keeping a close watch on potential rivals both within the family and beyond. The **internal power struggles**, along with the **external rivalries** with other noble houses in the Concord, ensure that the **Sorans must always be vigilant**, lest their grip on Aversia slip from their hands.
