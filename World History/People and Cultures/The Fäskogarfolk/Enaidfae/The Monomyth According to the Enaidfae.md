### The Enaidfae’s Version of the Monomyth

The **Enaidfae** version of the monomyth is steeped in the elemental and eldritch powers of their gods, **Thalassor, Sylvorn,** and **Zephyraxis**—the aspects of the **Three-Bodied God, Trium**. Their telling of the Great Exodus focuses on the **power of transformation**, the manipulation of nature’s raw forces, and their ability to commune with the elements of **ocean, land, and sky**. Their view of the **Great Prophet** is not one of a single leader, but as an individual blessed by the **Three Aspects**, who granted him the ability to shape reality through elemental power. The monomyth revolves around the **interplay of these aspects** and the **arcane knowledge** the Enaidfae have gained through their dark rituals and pacts.

### **1. The Dreaming of Thalassor: The First Revelation**

In the **Enaidfae** tradition, the **Great Prophet** is not depicted as a single human but as a chosen vessel for the **Three-Bodied God**. According to their myth, during the long years of captivity in the distant north, the Great Prophet received a vision from **Thalassor**, the Ocean Aspect. Thalassor, slumbering in the depths of his sunken city, sent forth dreams of the **ocean’s abyss** and its infinite power. The Prophet, blessed by these visions, was taught how to harness the **secrets of water and madness**.

- **Thalassor’s Gift**: The ocean revealed to the Prophet the **power of transformation**, the ability to change one’s form and mind as fluidly as water. This knowledge was both a blessing and a curse, as those who embraced it risked being consumed by madness. Thalassor whispered of ancient pacts and **eldritch power**, and the Prophet, in turn, taught the **Enaidfae** how to manipulate the **oceans and storms** to guide their journey.

### **2. The Rite of the Sylvorn: The Journey Through the Wild**

The **Great Exodus** of the Enaidfae was not a simple journey through barren desert but a trek through the **primal forests** and **eldritch groves** where **Sylvorn**, the Land Aspect, held dominion. Sylvorn’s wild power governed the forests, and his **Fae followers**—fauns, satyrs, and dark forest spirits—tested the Enaidfae as they crossed the southern lands. According to their myth, the **Great Prophet** struck a bargain with Sylvorn, offering sacrifices in exchange for safe passage through his domain.

- **Sylvorn’s Bargain**: Sylvorn demanded **blood sacrifices** and rituals to honor the primal power of the land. The Prophet led the Enaidfae in rites that called upon the **Fae** to guide them through the twisting, shifting forests. In return, the Enaidfae gained the power of **transformation**, allowing them to take on the forms of forest creatures and walk between worlds as changelings.

The **Stone Circles** found deep within the forests are said to be remnants of the **sacred pacts** made between the **Great Prophet** and Sylvorn. These circles are still used by the Enaidfae for their most sacred rituals, where the land itself can be called upon to **shift** and **bend** to their will.

### **3. Zephyraxis and the Tempest: The Sky’s Fury**

As the Enaidfae neared the end of their journey, they encountered the last trial: the fury of **Zephyraxis**, the Sky Aspect. Their myth speaks of a great storm sent by Zephyraxis, a test of the Enaidfae’s resolve and mastery over the elements. The storm raged for weeks, tearing apart the land and sea with wind, lightning, and thunder, but the **Great Prophet**, now imbued with the knowledge of both **Thalassor** and **Sylvorn**, stood firm.

- **Zephyraxis’ Trial**: The Prophet was taught how to **harness the storm**, using the wind and lightning to shape their path. Through ritual and sacrifice, the Prophet and the Enaidfae learned to commune with the sky, **summoning the wind** to speed their journey and calling down **lightning** to destroy their enemies. Zephyraxis, pleased by their mastery, granted them the **power of flight**, allowing the Enaidfae to soar on the wind as **Aerials**, spirits of the sky.

### **4. The Binding of the Three Aspects: The Prophet’s Ascension**

The Enaidfae version of the monomyth culminates not in the establishment of a homeland but in the **ascension of the Great Prophet** to become one with the **Three Aspects**. Unlike other cultures, who focus on the mortal nature of their Prophet, the Enaidfae believe that their Prophet was **transformed** into a being of elemental power, bound to the **Three-Bodied God, Trium**.

In the final moments of the **Great Exodus**, the Prophet was caught in a **celestial alignment**, where the forces of **ocean, land, and sky** converged. Through a ritual of **blood and storm**, the Prophet was **consumed** by the power of **Trium**, their body dissolving into the elements and becoming one with the Three Aspects.

- **The Eternal Trium**: The Prophet’s essence became part of **Trium**, the Three-Bodied God, and from that moment forward, the Enaidfae gained the ability to call upon the power of **all three aspects**. This act of **ascension** is seen as the greatest achievement of the Prophet, marking the Enaidfae as the **chosen people** of the elemental gods.

### **5. The Wild Hunt: A Legacy of Power**

The Enaidfae believe that their Great Prophet’s ascension initiated the cycle of the **Wild Hunt**, a sacred event that occurs when **Trium** awakens. During the Wild Hunt, the **Enaidfae** and their followers—**Deep Ones, Fae, and Aerials**—gather to perform **grand rituals**, raiding, pillaging, and making sacrifices in honor of the Three Aspects. It is during these events that the **true power** of the Enaidfae is revealed, as their shamans and high druids invoke the forces of **ocean, land, and sky** to **reshape reality**.

The **Wild Hunt** is not seen as a punishment but as a celebration of the Enaidfae’s mastery over the elements. It is a time of **great transformation**, when those who have proven themselves worthy are granted **greater powers**, while those who fail are consumed by the **eldritch forces** they sought to control.

### **6. The Prophet’s Return: The Awaited Convergence**

The Enaidfae believe that one day, the **Great Prophet** will return when the stars align once more, heralding a new era of **elemental dominance**. This event, known as the **Eternal Convergence**, will bring about the **complete unification** of the **Three Aspects**, and Trium will walk the world once again. The **Enaidfae** await this day, preparing through their rituals and sacrifices, constantly seeking greater power to ensure their place as the chosen servants of the **Three-Bodied God**.

When the **Prophet returns**, the Enaidfae believe that they will be granted dominion over the **natural world**, with the power to command **oceans, forests, and skies** at will. Their ultimate goal is not simply survival but **transcendence**, to become one with the **Three Aspects** and usher in a new age of **primal power**.

---

This version of the monomyth reflects the **Enaidfae’s deep connection to elemental forces** and their desire to wield **eldritch power** through their worship of the **Three-Bodied God, Trium**. Their focus on **arcane rituals, transformation, and sacrifice** marks them as a people who embrace the **chaos and power** of nature in its most dangerous forms, seeking not to control it but to **become one with it**. Their belief in the **Great Prophet’s ascension** as a unifying force of **ocean, land, and sky** showcases their ultimate goal of achieving **elemental mastery**.
