### **Historical Context**

The **Enaidfae** trace their lineage back to the ancient **Fäskogarfolk**, a once-unified people who were driven into the far southern wilderness. Over centuries, they diverged from their kin, the **Ättar**, forging a distinct path rooted in the worship of the **Three-Bodied God, Trium**. While their cousins bonded with the primal spirits of the moon, the Enaidfae turned to the **three aspects of Trium**—**Thalassor (Ocean), Sylvorn (Land),** and **Zephyraxis (Sky)**—for strength, knowledge, and guidance. Their alliance with these eldritch forces granted them arcane powers, deeply entwining their spiritual and physical existence with the elements of ocean, land, and sky.

Their history is one of mastery over nature’s most chaotic forces, and this pursuit of power has shaped their culture into one of ritualistic reverence for the **natural world**, secretive practices, and dark pacts with the elements. They are a people driven by the desire to command the very fabric of reality, believing that their ultimate destiny lies in **transcending mortal limitations** through the power of **Trium** and his aspects.

### **Religion**

#### **Core Beliefs**

The **Enaidfae** are devout worshipers of the **Three-Bodied God, Trium**, and their entire culture is centered around the reverence of his three aspects—**Thalassor**, **Sylvorn**, and **Zephyraxis**. Their belief system is built upon the idea that these aspects represent the **fundamental forces of existence**: the **ocean** symbolizes the fluidity of life and the power of transformation, the **land** embodies primal strength and natural cycles, and the **sky** represents freedom, chaos, and inspiration.

They view the world as a canvas upon which the **Three Aspects** paint their will, and the Enaidfae see themselves as both subjects and participants in this cosmic artistry. Their ultimate goal is to become one with these elements, embracing **transformation** in both body and spirit, so they may ascend to a higher state of existence alongside **Trium**. The Enaidfae believe that their **Great Prophet** transcended mortality by merging with the Three Aspects, and they seek to follow in his footsteps.

#### **Thalassor (Ocean Aspect)**
- **Domains:** Oceans, Secrets, Madness, Transformation
- **Beliefs:** Thalassor teaches the Enaidfae the value of change and the depths of the subconscious. He represents both the mysteries of the deep and the potential for personal and spiritual transformation, though often at the cost of sanity. Water is seen as a symbol of adaptability, fluidity, and hidden power.

#### **Sylvorn (Land Aspect)**
- **Domains:** Forests, Nature, Primal Power, Reproduction
- **Beliefs:** Sylvorn embodies the raw strength of the earth, the power of growth, and the cycle of life and death. He is the force that nurtures, but also the one that demands blood and sacrifice. His followers honor the primal connection between all living things and embrace their savage instincts, seeing themselves as guardians and participants in the **eternal cycle** of nature.

#### **Zephyraxis (Sky Aspect)**
- **Domains:** Sky, Storms, Freedom, Illusion
- **Beliefs:** Zephyraxis symbolizes the untamable force of the skies, the chaos of storms, and the fleeting nature of freedom. His followers believe that the sky offers liberation from the physical and spiritual constraints of the earth. Zephyraxis is seen as a trickster and a guide, pushing the Enaidfae toward **unpredictable paths of inspiration** and power.

### **Worship and Practices**

The **Enaidfae’s** worship is deeply ritualistic, revolving around the cycles of the **moon**, the **ocean’s tides**, the **seasons**, and the **storms** that sweep across their lands. Their ceremonies blend the primal and the arcane, with **blood sacrifices**, **transformative rites**, and **mystical hunts** playing key roles in their spiritual life.

#### **Rituals and Sacrifices**
- **Elemental Rituals**: Each aspect of Trium has its own rituals, performed in their sacred sites. For **Thalassor**, rituals are conducted by the sea, involving offerings of blood and sacrifice to gain the **ocean’s favor** or insight into hidden knowledge. **Sylvorn’s** rites are performed in dark, sacred forests, where **mass orgies** and **blood rituals** ensure bountiful harvests and fertility. **Zephyraxis** is honored during storms, with ceremonies calling down lightning and wind, offering metals and herbs burned to send their essence to the sky.
  
- **The Wild Hunt**: This is the most sacred event for the Enaidfae, occurring when all three aspects align, and their followers come together to participate in **chaotic hunts** where boundaries blur between land, sea, and sky. It’s a time of **transformation**, where the strongest among them are chosen by the aspects to become their emissaries.

#### **[[Martial Arts and Tattoos]]**
- **Elemental Martial Arts**: The Enaidfae have developed distinct schools of martial arts, each reflecting the power of one of Trium’s aspects. These martial arts incorporate **elemental techniques**—water’s flowing strikes, earth’s unyielding strength, and air’s unpredictable speed. Masters of these arts use their connection to the aspects to **channel elemental energy** into their movements, creating an art form that is both physical and spiritual.

- **Tattooed Warriors**: Enaidfae warriors and druids adorn their bodies with intricate tattoos that serve both as spiritual markings and practical protection. Using a **magick paste** that hardens their skin like steel, the tattoos act as **armor**. The **negative space** of the tattoos allows for flexibility, ensuring they can move freely even while their skin is hardened. Each tattoo is unique to the individual and reflects their connection to their chosen aspect, often depicting **waves, vines, clouds, or lightning bolts**.

The application of the **magick paste** is an **initiation ritual** in itself, with the paste being mixed from rare herbs, minerals, and **blood sacrifices** to empower the wearer with their aspect’s protection. This practice makes the Enaidfae warriors formidable in battle, blending **physical prowess** with **mystical defenses**.
