### **The Fäskogarfolk**
**Overview**:  
The **Fäskogarfolk** represent the remnants of an ancient and once-unified people who were driven into the cold southern reaches of the world. Over time, they diverged into two distinct cultures, the **Ättar** and the **Enaidfae**, each taking different paths in terms of spirituality, survival, and societal structure. While they share common ancestry, their alliances with different deities and their lifestyles have set them apart, and they often come into conflict with one another.

### **The Ättar: Totemic Warriors of the Southern Wilds**
The **Ättar** are a proud, martial people, known for their deep spiritual connection to their **totem animals** and their transformative abilities, granted by their pact with **Lunara Noctis**, the Moon Goddess. They are a people forged by hardship and survival in the frigid, forested wilderness of the far south, where life is harsh and unyielding.

#### **Culture and Spirituality**:
- **Totemic Heritage**: Each member of the **Ättar** is born with a connection to a specific totem animal (wolf, bear, lion, ox, etc.), which grants them certain natural traits. Over time, some choose to become **skinwalkers**, taking on the ability to transform into powerful hybrid creatures in exchange for parts of their essence.
- **Ritual and Sacrifice**: Life among the **Ättar** is deeply ritualistic, with regular ceremonies honoring **Lunara Noctis** and their totem spirits. The decision to become a skinwalker is seen as both an honor and a curse, as it involves giving up a part of oneself to the moon goddess, eventually leading to madness and death.
- **Communal Living**: The **Ättar** live in close-knit tribes, where communal bonds are strong. Their **mead halls** serve as the heart of their settlements, where warriors, families, and shamans gather for feasts, storytelling, and religious ceremonies.
- **Martial Society**: Valor in battle is highly regarded, and warriors who embody the strength and spirit of their totems are honored with titles and feasts. Their transformative abilities make them formidable defenders of their territory.

#### **Territory and Lifestyle**:
- The **Ättar** live in the cold, rugged **southern forests**, where survival depends on hunting, foraging, and maintaining strong communal ties. Their settlements are fortified against both the elements and external threats, especially the **Grobi**, an enemy they have fought for generations.
- Their society is organized into **tribes**, each led by the leading family associated with a particular totem animal. These tribes work together when necessary but maintain autonomy in daily governance and spiritual practices.

#### **Political Relations**:
- **Ättar and Enaidfae Rivalry**: Despite their shared ancestry, the **Ättar** often find themselves at odds with the **Enaidfae**, whom they see as having forsaken the primal, spiritual bond with **Lunara Noctis**. Conflicts between the two are frequent, though they are equally matched in strength.
- **Defenders of the Southern Lands**: The **Ättar** have long served as defenders of their southern forests, standing guard against both natural and supernatural threats. Their warrior ethos has made them stalwart protectors of their people.

### **The Enaidfae: Servants of Trium’s Aspects**
The **Enaidfae** took a different spiritual path, aligning themselves with the **three aspects** of the **three-bodied god Trium**—**Thalassor**, **Sylvorn**, and **Zephyraxis**—and weaving their worship into the fabric of their daily lives. While they share the same ancestral roots as the **Ättar**, their bond with the **Trium aspects** has granted them powers tied to the elements of ocean, land, and sky, leading them to a more mysterious and arcane lifestyle.

#### **Culture and Spirituality**:
- **Devotees of the Trium Aspects**: The **Enaidfae** worship **Thalassor (Ocean)**, **Sylvorn (Land)**, and **Zephyraxis (Sky)** in their separate forms, with each aspect influencing different facets of their society. This division has led to a highly ritualistic culture that revolves around natural elements and primal forces.
- **Rituals and Sacrifice**: The **Enaidfae** engage in secretive rituals that often involve blood sacrifices, wild hunts, and pacts with eldritch forces. Their worship is darker and more dangerous than the **Ättar**’s, often invoking transformation, madness, and raw elemental power.
- **Magical Prowess**: Unlike the **Ättar**’s totemic transformations, the **Enaidfae** draw their power from the land, sea, and sky, granting them arcane abilities tied to nature, weather, and the ocean. High druids and shamans serve as intermediaries between the **Enaidfae** and their gods, leading rituals that harness these forces.

#### **Territory and Lifestyle**:
- The **Enaidfae** reside in the coastal regions and dense forests at the southern edges of the world. They prefer to live close to **sacred sites**, such as hidden groves, cliffs overlooking the ocean, and ancient stone circles where the influence of the **Trium aspects** is strongest.
- **Tribal Hierarchies**: The **Enaidfae** are organized into tribes, each with a dominant aspect of the **three-bodied god**. This structure creates a balance of power among the tribes, as none can dominate the others without disrupting the natural order.
  
#### **Political Relations**:
- **Alliance with Dark Forces**: The **Enaidfae** are known for making deals with dark and eldritch entities, such as the **Fae**, **Deep Ones**, and **Aerials**, which further deepens the divide between them and the **Ättar**. These alliances have made the **Enaidfae** both feared and respected by neighboring peoples.
- **Occasional Conflict with the Ättar**: Though they share common ancestry, the **Enaidfae**’s allegiance to the **Trium aspects** often brings them into conflict with the **Ättar**, especially when their rituals disrupt the natural balance or encroach upon **Ättar** territory.

### **Conclusion: The Fäskogarfolk**
The **Fäskogarfolk** represent a culture divided by divergent spiritual paths. The **Ättar** have become warriors of the natural world, aligned with the cycles of the moon and totemic spirits, while the **Enaidfae** have embraced the arcane and eldritch forces of the **three-bodied god**, seeking power and knowledge through their dark rituals. Despite their shared ancestry, these two cultures find themselves in frequent conflict, though both remain staunch defenders of their harsh, frozen homelands.

Their connection to primal forces, their harsh environment, and their warrior ethos make the **Fäskogarfolk** a formidable presence in the southern regions of the world, with their influence felt in both the physical and supernatural realms.
