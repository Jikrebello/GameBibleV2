### The Ättar's Version of the Monomyth

The **Ättar** version of the monomyth reflects their connection to their totem animals, the harsh southern wilderness, and their devotion to **Lunara Noctis**, the moon goddess who grants them their powers of transformation. The **Great Exodus** is viewed through a primal, survivalist lens, with themes of transformation, resilience, and sacrifice, as their ancestors were led out of bondage by the **Great Prophet**. However, unlike other cultures, the Ättar emphasize the **Prophet's connection to the moon** and his **final transformation into a wolf**, symbolizing their own sacred transformations.

### **1. The Moon's Blessing: The Call of the Great Wolf**
In the Ättar version of the monomyth, the **Great Prophet** is known not just as a liberator but as the **First Skinwalker**, a figure chosen by **Lunara Noctis** herself. According to their legends, the Prophet was born under the light of the full moon, marked by Lunara from birth as her chosen emissary. His eyes gleamed with the silver light of the moon, and from a young age, it was said that he could hear the call of the wolves echoing in the night.

The **Great Prophet** was destined to lead his people across the frozen wilderness and **Great Glass Desert**, but he did so not through divine plagues or miracles like in other versions of the myth. Instead, he led by becoming **one with the wild**, teaching his followers how to survive in the brutal environment through cunning, strength, and communion with the spirits of the totem animals.

- **Lunara’s Blessing**: As the Prophet journeyed across the land of the giants, he made a sacred pact with **Lunara Noctis**, who granted him and his followers the power to transform into their totemic forms. This transformation gave them the strength to survive the dangers of the wilderness and the relentless pursuit of their enemies. The moon goddess taught him the ancient rites of skinwalking, and he passed this knowledge to the **First Tribes** of the Ättar.

### **2. The Hunt for Survival: Trials of the Totem Beasts**
The story of the **Great Exodus** among the Ättar is not one of passive following but a series of intense trials where the people had to prove themselves worthy of Lunara’s gifts. Each totem spirit—**the Wolf, the Bear, the Lion, the Ox**—appeared before the Prophet’s followers in dreams and visions, challenging them to earn the right to carry their power.

- **The Wolf Spirit** tested their endurance, leading the people through a harrowing chase across the frozen plains, where they had to hunt or be hunted.
- **The Bear Spirit** demanded displays of immense strength and resilience, challenging the people to survive the harshest winters and overpower their enemies.
- **The Lion Spirit** tested their courage and cunning, as the followers had to prove themselves in battles against not only other men but the beasts of the wild.
- **The Ox Spirit** required feats of stamina and unity, forcing the people to endure great hardships together, carrying their wounded and elderly on their backs as they moved through the treacherous land.

Only after passing these trials were the Ättar granted the full power of their totem animals, and from that point on, their connection to their **totems** became a central aspect of their culture and identity.

### **3. The Prophet's Final Transformation: The Wolf's Ascension**
Unlike other versions of the monomyth, in the Ättar tradition, the **Great Prophet** did not defy the divine will in his later years. Instead, it is believed that **Lunara Noctis** called him to her side to serve as her eternal guardian. As the Prophet grew older, his connection to the moon goddess deepened, and he became more attuned to the cycles of the moon.

The Ättar tell the story of the Prophet’s **Final Transformation**—a sacred event where, under the light of the full moon, he **surrendered his humanity** and fully embraced his totem spirit, transforming into a great silver wolf. This transformation was not seen as a punishment but as the ultimate reward, the culmination of his journey along the path of the skinwalker.

In this form, the **Great Wolf Prophet** led his people across the **Great Glass Desert**, guiding them through the treacherous wilderness to their new home in the southern forests. His howl could be heard echoing across the mountains, inspiring strength and unity among the people, and it is said that his spirit still watches over the **Ättar** as they continue their sacred duty as protectors of the southern wilds.

### **4. The Fracturing of the First Tribes: The Divided Clans**
While the **Great Wolf Prophet** was revered and loved by his people, his death—or **ascension**—led to the eventual fracturing of the **First Tribes**. Without his guidance, the people began to **disagree over the interpretation of his teachings**. Some believed that the path of transformation was the greatest gift, while others feared the cost it exacted upon the soul. These differences eventually led to the formation of distinct tribes, each dedicated to a different totem animal, and each interpreting the **Prophet’s lessons** in their own way.

The **Wolf Clan** continued to follow the path of the skinwalker, embracing the power of transformation fully, while others, like the **Bear Clan** and the **Ox Clan**, became more cautious, valuing the strength of their totemic inheritance without fully surrendering to the pull of the moon. The **Lion Clan**, meanwhile, emphasized valor and leadership, often clashing with the other clans over their interpretations of the **Prophet’s final teachings**.

### **5. The Moontouched Curse: The Price of Lunara’s Gift**
The **Ättar** version of the monomyth also emphasizes the **Moontouched Curse** as a cautionary tale about the dangers of fully embracing the power of transformation. The **Great Prophet’s** transformation into the **Great Wolf** was seen as a divine blessing, but for mortals, the constant pull of Lunara’s power takes a heavy toll.

The **Moontouched Curse**—a state of madness and eventual death that overtakes skinwalkers who transform too frequently—is a constant reminder to the **Ättar** of the delicate balance they must maintain. While Lunara grants great power, that power comes at the cost of one’s mind and soul. The story of the **Moontouched**, those who have lost themselves to the moon’s pull, is told as a warning to young warriors who might seek to overuse their transformative abilities.

### **6. The Eternal Vigil: The Great Wolf's Legacy**
The story ends with the **Great Wolf Prophet** ascending to the moon, where he continues to watch over the **Ättar** as **Lunara’s guardian**. His spirit is said to roam the southern forests in the form of a great silver wolf, guiding those who are lost and protecting the tribes from supernatural threats.

The **Great Wolf Prophet** is honored during **the Hunt of the Full Moon**, a sacred festival where the **Ättar** gather to reenact the trials of the totem beasts and offer sacrifices to **Lunara Noctis**. During this festival, the **skinwalkers** among them are encouraged to transform and embrace their totem spirits, remembering the legacy of their ancestors while being mindful of the dangers of the **Moontouched Curse**.

In the end, the **Ättar** believe that one day, the **Great Wolf Prophet** will return during the **Eternal Eclipse**, when **Lunara** will cast her shadow over the world, and the totem spirits will rise to lead their people into a new age of strength and unity.

This version of the monomyth reflects the **Ättar’s primal connection to nature**, their belief in transformation, and their reverence for **Lunara Noctis**. It speaks to their deep bond with their totem animals and their constant struggle to balance the power granted to them by the moon goddess with the heavy price it exacts. The **Great Prophet** is not just a distant figure of legend but the **First Skinwalker**, a symbol of the path they all walk as they honor their ancestors and protect their people.
