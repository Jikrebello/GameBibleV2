The **Thalmyric Empire** is a grand and ancient civilization, a direct successor to the once-mighty **Atherian Empire**, which once ruled the known world. Situated along the **Thalassian Sea**, it is a proud nation steeped in tradition, mysticism, and relentless warfare. Once part of the broader **Atherian Empire**, the Thalmyric Empire came to be due to invasion by the Ahl-e-Ahd which lead to the Atherian Empire splitting due to the withdrawal of troops/ manpower and resources from the western part of the empire in order to fight off the invasion in the east, which solidified into the smaller eastern part of the empire as being distinct due because of religious and political tensions and differences between the eastern  and western parts of the empire, leading the eastern part to developing its own identity and its version of the faith of the **Redeemer**. While sharing the same core religious beliefs as Eclessia to the west, the Thalmyric interpretation is more mystical and introspective, with a strong focus on divine mysteries and spiritual enlightenment.

The empire faces constant pressure from its southern enemies, the **Ahl-e-Ahd**, and has shaped itself around a culture of **reconquest** to reclaim the lands lost during past invasions. With its strategic location, historical roots in the Atherian Empire, and religious schism, the Thalmyric Empire stands as a powerful and culturally rich civilization, both spiritually driven and militarily focused.

### **Historical Background**

The Thalmyric Empire traces its roots to the **Atherian Empire**, once the dominant force in the world. As the Atherian Empire expanded, it grew vast, encompassing what is now **Eclessia**, the **Sestaran Peninsula**, and the lands of the Thalmyric Empire itself. However, as the empire expanded westward, cracks began to form.

When the **Faith of the Redeemer** first arose in the western, less developed regions of the Atherian Empire (now Eclessia), it spread rapidly among the peasantry. Eventually, this faith gained momentum, eventually establishing the **Sanctum Divinitatis** in the small but resource rich Kingdom of Aurelia. The faith was slower to take hold in the more culturally advanced eastern territories, leading to growing tensions between the two regions, however, the Faith of the Redeemer eventually settled to become the dominant religion in both regions, with the outlaw and banning of the old "pagan" religions of Astratheon and the worship of Trium (the 3 bodied god). 

The fall of the Atherian Empire eventually led to the region of **Eclessia** falling into an interregnum  in the west and the Thalmyric Empire in the east. The **schism** in the faith mirrored the political split, with the **Thalmyric Church** developing its own mystical, introspective interpretation of the Redeemer, while the Eclessian **Sanctum Divinitatis** took on a more worldly and institutional role.

Today, the Thalmyric Empire claims to be the true successor of the Atherian Empire, while the Eclessian church claims that whoever is able to unify the various kingdoms and territories of Eclessia under a single ruler again will be divinely blessed by the church as the true inheritor to the Atherian Empire. The ongoing rivalry between the two churches and their regions is a significant feature of the political landscape, with both sides vying for religious and cultural dominance.

### **Religious Schism and the Thalmyric Church**

The **Thalmyric Church** follows the same core beliefs of the **Faith of the Redeemer** as the Eclessian Church but differs significantly in practice and interpretation. The Thalmyric Church is highly mystical, focusing on **personal communion with the divine**, **visions**, and **asceticism**. The schism between the two branches of the faith stems from disagreements over church structure, the role of the clergy, and the interpretation of divine will.

The **Patriarch of Veridun** serves as the highest religious authority in the Thalmyric Church. The church remains deeply intertwined with the imperial government, guiding the emperor in spiritual matters and supporting the empire's ongoing military campaigns against the Ahl-e-Ahd. The **reconquest efforts** to reclaim territories lost to the Ahl-e-Ahd are seen as a **holy duty**, with the church often leading both the spiritual and military charge.

### **The Reconquest and Conflict with the Ahl-e-Ahd**

One of the defining features of the Thalmyric Empire is its long-standing conflict with the **Ahl-e-Ahd**, a powerful empire to the south and east that follows a distinct faith centered on **contract-binding magic**. The **Ahl-e-Ahd invasions** began centuries ago, quickly overrunning several key southern territories that include the now named Velian States as well as establishing the **Emirate of Zanthir**. This event set the stage for the Thalmyric Empire’s ongoing **reconquest** efforts, which are as much about spiritual redemption as they are about military victory.

The war with the Ahl-e-Ahd is both a military and religious struggle. The Thalmyric Empire views the reconquest of its southern territories as a **divinely mandated mission**, and the Eastern Church plays a crucial role in framing the conflict as a holy war. However, the Ahl-e-Ahd’s advanced **contract-based magic** and their disciplined slave armies make this a prolonged and grueling struggle. Some of the conquered lands have developed into **blended territories**, where Ahl-e-Ahd influence remains strong despite ongoing Thalmyric resistance.
