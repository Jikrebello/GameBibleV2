The **Thalmyric Church** is the dominant religious institution in the **Thalmyric Empire**, the eastern half of the once-mighty Atherian Empire. Unlike its western counterpart, the **Eclessian Church**, the Thalmyric Church developed in a crucible of war, invasion, and relentless conflict with the **Ahl-e-Ahd**. Shaped by the constant threat of invasion and the struggle to reclaim lost territories, the Thalmyric Church combines the **mystical**, **ascetic**, and **fiery zeal** of the Redeemer’s teachings, blending them with the ethos of a society constantly engaged in **reconquest** and survival.

### **Historical Context**

The **Thalmyric Church** emerged after the collapse of the Atherian Empire during the invasion of the **Ahl-e-Ahd**. While both the eastern and western halves of the Atherian Empire eventually converted to the **Faith of the Redeemer**, the persecution of the faithful in the east lasted longer, and the final adoption of the Redeemer’s teachings came after a protracted period of warfare and suppression. 

When the **Ahl-e-Ahd** began their invasion, the Atherian Empire withdrew to the east, leading to a sharp division between the faith practices of the east and west. As the Thalmyric people faced constant existential threats, their interpretation of the faith took on a unique character, shaped by the need for both **spiritual resilience** and **militant zeal**. The Thalmyric Church became deeply entwined with the military and political leadership, and its doctrines emphasize a more mystical and martial approach to the Redeemer’s teachings.

### **Structure of the Thalmyric Church**

#### **1. The Patriarchate of Veridun**
The **Patriarchate of Veridun** is the spiritual center of the Thalmyric Church, headquartered in the city of **Caleran**, the capital of the **Kingdom of Veridun**. The **Patriarch** serves as the head of the church and is both a **spiritual leader** and a key political figure, often advising the emperor on religious and political matters. The Patriarchate emphasizes a close connection between the church and state, viewing the empire’s ongoing **reconquest efforts** as part of the divine mission.

- **The Patriarch**: The **Patriarch of Veridun** is the highest religious authority in the Thalmyric Church. He is seen as the spiritual heir of the Redeemer’s legacy in the east, a role that carries immense religious and political power. The Patriarch serves as a guide to the emperor and leads the church in interpreting the divine will during times of war and peace.

- **The Council of Flame**: The **Council of Flame** is the advisory body to the Patriarch, composed of senior bishops, ascetics, and theologians. They oversee the enforcement of religious law, theological debates, and the administration of the church across the empire. The council also plays a crucial role in the **blessing of military campaigns**, particularly in the ongoing reconquest of lands held by the **Ahl-e-Ahd**.

#### **2. Ecclesiastical Hierarchy**
The Thalmyric Church is structured with a hierarchy that mirrors the **military organization** of the empire, reinforcing the close relationship between faith and war.

- **Archbishops of Flame**: The Archbishops are the spiritual overseers of the major regions within the Thalmyric Empire. Each archbishop is responsible for interpreting the Redeemer’s teachings in ways that support the empire’s ongoing reconquest efforts, and they often accompany military leaders on campaigns to provide spiritual guidance and blessings for their armies.

- **Bishops of Light**: Bishops serve as spiritual leaders of the dioceses under the archbishops, organizing local worship, leading prayers, and maintaining the spiritual health of their communities. In addition to their religious duties, bishops play an important role in rallying their communities during times of war, ensuring that the faith serves as a unifying force.

- **Priests and Monks**: Priests provide the day-to-day spiritual guidance to the people, leading prayers and rituals in local parishes and monasteries. **Monastic orders** are common throughout the Thalmyric Church, with many monks dedicating their lives to spiritual isolation, **contemplation**, and **ascetic practices**, believing that their suffering brings them closer to the Redeemer’s own sacrifice.
