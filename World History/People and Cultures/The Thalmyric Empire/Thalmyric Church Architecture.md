### **Architectural Features:**

#### **1. Exterior Design**
- **Overall Structure**:  
  The exterior of a **Thalmyric church** is less focused on outward grandeur and more on **spiritual significance**. These churches are often built on **isolated hilltops**, **cliff sides**, or near **mountain ranges**, symbolizing their closeness to the divine. The structures are typically made of **dark stone**, such as **basalt** or **granite**, giving them a somber, ancient appearance. Their design is stark but **elegant**, with a focus on geometric shapes that symbolize the **mysteries of faith**.
  
  - **Shape and Layout**:  
    Thalmyric churches often follow a **square** or **circular** layout, representing the **eternal cycle of life** and the **mysteries of creation**. The circular designs, in particular, are seen as symbolic of the **cosmic order** and the **divine wheel** that governs all things.

- **Central Spire and Symbolism**:  
  Rather than towering bell structures or domes, Thalmyric churches typically feature a **single, central spire** that stretches into the sky. This spire represents the **ascent to spiritual enlightenment**, often topped with a **symbolic flame** or **phoenix**, showing the Redeemer’s connection to the Lord. The flame at the top is a **beacon of faith**, symbolizing the **inner fire** of devotion that burns within all believers.

- **Carved Facades**:  
  The facades are carved with **intricate runes**, **geometric patterns**, and **sacred symbols**, all representing **spiritual concepts** such as **purity**, **sacrifice**, and **transformation**. Many of the carvings feature **angels**, **saints**, and **visions** from the mystics who have had direct spiritual encounters with the divine. These carvings are more **abstract** and **symbolic** than in Eclessia, reflecting the **mystical focus** of the Thalmyric Church.

- **Entryway and Pilgrimage**:  
  The **doorways** are often framed by stone arches covered in **ascetic imagery**—depicting the **hardships of spiritual pilgrimage**, fasting, and prayer.

#### **2. Interior Design**

- **Sanctum of Light and Shadow**:  
  The interior of a Thalmyric church is designed to evoke both **mystery and awe**.

  - **Candlelight**:  
    The predominant source of light inside is from **candles**, which are used in abundance, their flickering flames representing the **soul’s connection to the divine**. Long rows of **bronze candelabras** illuminate the space, creating an ethereal, shifting light that mirrors the **mystical faith** of the Thalmyrics.

- **The High Altar**:  
  Unlike the grand, ornate altars in Eclessia, the **high altar** in a Thalmyric church is much more **austere**. It is typically made of a single block of **unadorned stone**, symbolizing the **foundation of faith** and the **unshakable truths** revealed through devotion. Above the altar, there may be a **carved stone relief** of the **Redeemer** or the **flame symbol** that is central to Thalmyric spirituality.

    The altar is surrounded by **sacred geometrical symbols**, often **interlocking circles**, triangles, and crosses that represent the **trinity of divine mysteries**—the **body**, **soul**, and **spirit** of the Redeemer.

- **Chapel of Mystics**:  
  Many Thalmyric churches contain **side chapels** dedicated to **mystics** and **ascetics** who have achieved divine communion through **fasting**, **prayer**, and **meditation**. These chapels are often filled with **meditation mats**, **bronze censers** burning **incense**, and **symbols of the spiritual journey**.

- **Ceiling and Dome Murals**:  
  While many churches are more subdued, the **ceilings** and **domes** in some Thalmyric churches are richly painted with **cosmic visions**—depictions of the **heavens**, **angels**, and **celestial realms**. These murals are designed to remind the faithful of the **divine mysteries** that await beyond the material world.

  Thalmyric churches house **sacred relics** of **Thalmyric saints**—monks and mystics who achieved divine revelation.

- **Flame and Phoenix Motif**:
