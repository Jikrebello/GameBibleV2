The **Thalmyric Empire** is a grand and ancient civilization that rose to power through its connection to the **Thalassian Sea** and its strategic coastal and inland territories. Once part of the broader **Atherian Empire**, the Thalmyric Empire split off due to **religious schism** and political tensions, forming its own identity as a powerful and resilient state, deeply connected to its own version of the church and mysticism.

### **Historical Background**

The **Thalmyric Empire** emerged as a dominant force in the eastern regions of the world, with its origins tracing back to its position as part of the **Eclessian Imperium**. After a **schism** over theological and political disagreements, the Thalmyric Empire developed its own distinct **Eastern Church** and began asserting its independence.

However, this independence came at a cost, as the empire soon faced waves of invasions from the southern **Ahl-e-Ahd** forces, who brought their **contract-based magic** and fierce military discipline to bear on the empire’s southern territories. The resulting conflict has defined much of the Thalmyric Empire’s recent history, with constant warfare and the **reconquest efforts** to reclaim the lands lost to the invaders becoming central to its culture and identity.

### **Religious Schism and the Eastern Church**

The **Eastern Church** in the Thalmyric Empire plays a central role in both the spiritual and political lives of its citizens. After breaking from the **Eclessian Church**, the **Eastern Church** embraced **mysticism, iconography**, and the belief in a **personal connection to the divine**. This church remains a powerful force, guiding the people and rulers in their efforts to reclaim their lands from the **Ahl-e-Ahd**.

The **Patriarch of Veridun** serves as the highest religious authority in the empire, and **monastic orders**, **crusading knights**, and **religious festivals** permeate daily life. The **reconquest efforts** against the Ahl-e-Ahd are seen as a holy mission, with the church offering both spiritual and military guidance.

### **The Reconquest and Conflict with the Ahl-e-Ahd**

The invasion of the **Ahl-e-Ahd** from the southern deserts was a transformative event for the Thalmyric Empire. The **Ahl-e-Ahd**, with their powerful **contract-based magic** and structured military campaigns, overran several key southern territories, including the strategic **Emirate of Zanthir**. Since then, the Thalmyric Empire has been engaged in a protracted **reconquest** to reclaim these lost lands.

The war is both a military and spiritual struggle, as the Eastern Church casts the conflict in religious terms, declaring the **retaking of territories** a holy duty. The Ahl-e-Ahd remain formidable, and their influence has permanently altered the cultural and political landscape of the empire, creating **blended territories** where Ahl-e-Ahd rule has left lasting marks.
