In the sacred traditions of the **Ahl-e-Ahd**, the story of the Great Exodus has been passed down through generations, evolving into a myth steeped in mystery, contract-binding, and celestial destiny. Over time, the clear message of the Lord became intertwined with the intricate laws of contracts, devils, and cosmic order. This version of the monomyth, known as **"The Journey of the Last Contract,"** reflects the Ahl-e-Ahd’s unique worldview.

#### **1. The Creation and Fall of Humanity**

According to the **Al-Ahdiya** faith, the world began with the Lord crafting humanity from the dust of the stars, binding their fate to the cosmic **Scroll of the Universe**. Humanity was granted dominion over the earth, not by favor but through the divine **Contract of Dominion**, a sacred pact that gave them the authority to govern as long as they remained loyal to the Lord’s will.

However, the Lord’s greatest servant, a being known as the **Shaitan al-Mu'ahid** (The Adversary of the Pact), grew jealous of humanity’s power. Shaitan al-Mu'ahid had once been the Lord’s greatest enforcer of contracts, but the creation of humanity as the Lord's chosen administrators of the world angered him. Believing that humans were not worthy of their divine contract, he sought to break it by leading them into disobedience.

Shaitan al-Mu'ahid’s rebellion began as he convinced humanity that they had the power to forge their own contracts, apart from the Lord’s will. With whispers of false promises, he tempted them to break the **First Pact**, leading to their downfall. As a result, the original **Cosmic Order** was torn asunder, and the world was thrown into chaos, where both good and evil forces vied for control. Humanity, now bound to the earth in both body and spirit, had lost the favor of the Lord.

#### **2. The Rule of the Giants and the Binding of Humanity**

In the Ahl-e-Ahd telling, the fallen world was soon dominated by the **Jabbaran al-Samawy** (Celestial Giants), the tyrannical offspring of the **Menhir** and **Idols**—beings who had once served as the enforcers of divine contracts but had now turned their backs on the Lord and bound themselves to the elements and dreams. These Giants established vast empires and enslaved humanity through contracts of **bondage** and **servitude**, using intricate laws to trap the souls of men and women in endless cycles of subjugation.

Each Giant empire represented a different aspect of tyranny:

- The **Nuzir of Qanglun**, the mountain giants, forged contracts that chained the land itself, forcing the people to toil endlessly in barren fields and mines. Their magic was bound to the cycles of war and death, and they claimed the very blood of their slaves as their due.
- The **Nisqatar of Ishkar**, the serpent giants, established their rule through greed and promises of wealth, luring humans into contracts of debt and servitude. Their spiraling towers rose like snakes along the banks of the great rivers, their wealth hoarded through treachery and manipulation.
- The **Abshir of Xulat**, the obsidian giants, ruled through blood pacts, demanding human sacrifices to fuel their war machines and maintain their empire. They crafted contracts of blood, binding their subjects to the harshest conditions, where even death was not an escape.
- The **Nayathum**, the techno-giants, sought to transcend their own nature by binding themselves to the stars and the moon. They enslaved humanity in the name of progress, crafting a contract that promised ascension but delivered only servitude to machines and the heavens.

In this version of the myth, the Giants are not simply oppressive rulers but cunning manipulators of divine law. They bound humanity in chains of cosmic law, trapping them through contracts that seemed unbreakable.

#### **3. The Rise of the Great Prophet: "Mu'ahid al-Khalas"**

In the depths of this despair, the Lord sent forth a chosen one: **Mu'ahid al-Khalas** (The Arbiter of Salvation). This prophet was not a mere mortal but the last bearer of the **Divine Quill**, the only instrument capable of rewriting the broken cosmic contracts. 

Mu'ahid al-Khalas traveled through each empire of the Giants, armed not with weapons but with the knowledge of divine law. He broke the contracts that bound the people, tearing apart the magical seals that enslaved them and offering them freedom in the name of the Lord. However, the Giants resisted, and with each contract broken, calamities struck their empires:

- In **Qanglun**, the land itself rebelled as the Prophet tore apart the pacts that bound the earth. Mountains crumbled, and rivers dried, leaving the empire in ruin.
- In **Ishkar**, the Prophet dismantled the contracts of wealth and debt, turning gold to dust and bringing famine to the serpent empire.
- In **Xulat**, the blood pacts were shattered, and the obsidian warlords were consumed by volcanic eruptions as the very ground beneath their ziggurats erupted in fury.
- In **Nayathum**, the Prophet struck at the core of their technological contracts, causing their celestial machines to malfunction. Their spires collapsed, and their reach toward the heavens was lost.

The Prophet’s miracles were seen as **Divine Judgments**, sent by the Lord to remind humanity of the true order of the universe. Those who accepted the Prophet’s teachings joined him in the **Great Exodus** from the land of the Giants. Those who rejected him were left to their fates, trapped in the final revolts and chaos that destroyed the Giant empires.

#### **4. The Crossing of the Endless Sands**

The **Great Exodus** led the Ahl-e-Ahd people across the vast **Great Glass Desert**, a shimmering, treacherous land of endless dunes and glittering sands. In this version of the story, the desert is a place of great trial and purification. As the Prophet led his followers, they were constantly tested by both the natural and spiritual world. It is said that the **Devils of the Desert** sought to tempt them with false contracts, offering water, wealth, and power in exchange for their souls.

However, the Prophet, wielding the **Divine Quill**, rejected each offer, teaching his people to trust in the Lord alone and to recognize the deceptive contracts of the devils. At every oasis, the Prophet would carve new **covenants** into the sands, ensuring that his people were bound by the true contracts of the Lord.

#### **5. The Fall of the Prophet and the Divergence of the People**

As the exodus approached the edges of the **promised land**, the Lord gave a command: the Prophet was to lead his people to a place of refuge for three generations, where they would build a grand city and grow strong in faith. However, **Mu'ahid al-Khalas**, much like the prophets of old, questioned the wisdom of the Lord’s plan. Fearing the long delay would weaken his people’s resolve, he sought to press onward, directly toward the promised land.

In defying the Lord’s direct instruction, the Prophet invited his own doom. A great sandstorm, said to be the work of the **Shaitan al-Mu'ahid**, rose from the desert, engulfing the Prophet. His body was never recovered, lost to the storm. With the Prophet’s death, the people became divided, no longer bound by a single vision or leader. Without the divine contracts to guide them, the once-unified people splintered.

#### **6. The Birth of the Ahl-e-Ahd**

After the death of **Mu'ahid al-Khalas**, the people scattered. Some sought their own paths, forming new tribes and kingdoms. However, a small remnant remained true to the Prophet’s teachings. These survivors, known as the **Ahl-e-Ahd**, believed they had not yet reached the promised land and chose to live as nomads, traveling the desert in search of the fulfillment of the **Final Contract**.

This group eventually became the **Caliphate of Al-Qahur**, founded by the **Final Prophet**, who claimed to have been visited by an angel of the Lord. This angel revealed the true nature of the cosmos, explaining that all of existence was governed by divine contracts and that humanity had the power to shape its own fate through these pacts. The Final Prophet learned the sacred art of contract-writing and forged the **Covenant of Al-Qahur**, a massive agreement that brought water to the desert and established the holy city. The **4444 devils** who dug the oasis were bound by this covenant, and to this day, the **Ahl-e-Ahd** believe their spiritual journey continues, guided by the eternal contracts forged between humanity, devils, and the Lord.

This version of the monomyth reflects the Ahl-e-Ahd's deep connection to contracts, cosmic law, and the tension between submission and rebellion. It is a story of divine authority, disobedience, and the never-ending journey toward spiritual fulfillment in a world governed by mystical agreements.
