### **1. The Caliphate of Iqashar**

**Inspiration**: Baghdad  
**Capital**: **Iqashar**  
**Territory**: The **Cradle of Sands**, a desert heartland rich with ancient architecture and history.  
**Ruling Class**: The **House of Al-Muhar**, a dynasty deeply entrenched in the old ways of the Ahl-e-Ahd.

**Overview**:  
The **Caliphate of Iqashar** is the oldest and most historically significant of the Ahl-e-Ahd caliphates. Located in the **heart of the Ahl-e-Ahd empire**, Iqashar was built upon the ruins of a long-lost civilization, with many of its grandest buildings repurposed from **conquered desert peoples**. The city’s architecture reflects this ancient legacy, blending the grandeur of the past with the imposing structures of the Ahl-e-Ahd conquerors.

The **House of Al-Muhar**, the ruling family, has maintained power for centuries through a strict adherence to **contract law**, ensuring that every aspect of society is governed by ironclad agreements. Slavery is a major part of the economy, with non-Ahl-e-Ahd slaves working in the fields and forges of the city. **Outsiders** are considered **outside the law**, meaning they have no protections, making them vulnerable to exploitation and abuse unless they can protect themselves through power or wealth.

However, in recent decades, the **Iqashar Caliphate** has faced increasing pressure from **nomadic horse lords**, who have begun raiding the desert borders. This has caused the once-powerful caliphate to become **isolationist**, focusing on protecting its wealth and status rather than expanding its influence.

**Key Features**:  
- **Ancient Architecture**: Iqashar’s buildings are a mix of ancient desert cultures and Ahl-e-Ahd dominance.
- **Contract-Based Society**: Every interaction, trade, and relationship is governed by contracts, with devastating consequences for breaches.
- **Nomadic Threats**: The caliphate is under constant threat from nomadic raiders, forcing it to become more inward-looking.

**Influence**:  
While still powerful, Iqashar’s influence is waning as it turns inward to protect itself from the growing nomadic threat. Its isolationism has led to tensions with other Ahl-e-Ahd caliphates.

### **2. The Caliphate of Al-Qahur**

**Inspiration**: Umayyad Dynasty  
**Capital**: **Al-Qahur**  
**Territory**: The **Oasis of Flames**, a fertile and sacred land created through powerful contracts with the **4444 devils**.  
**Ruling Class**: The **Imam-King of Al-Qahur**, the religious and political leader of the caliphate.

**Overview**:  
The **Caliphate of Al-Qahur** is seen as the spiritual heart of the **Al-Ahdiya religion**. According to legend, the oasis that sustains the city was created by the **Great Prophet** of the Ahl-e-Ahd, who commissioned **4444 devils** to dig the oasis as part of a massive contract. The city itself is considered a **holy site**, and millions of Ahl-e-Ahd believers make **pilgrimages** to Al-Qahur each year to pay homage to the prophet and the site where the first contracts were forged.

Al-Qahur is ruled by the **Imam-King**, a spiritual leader who oversees both the religious and secular life of the caliphate. The city's vast wealth comes from **religious tourism**, as well as its fertile lands, which are irrigated by the oasis. However, the laws of Al-Qahur are among the most **strict** in the Ahl-e-Ahd world, with severe punishments for any breach of contracts. Outsiders are treated with disdain, and their presence is heavily regulated.

**Slavery** is a prominent part of society, and non-Ahl-e-Ahd slaves, especially those captured from **raids** into foreign territories, are tasked with maintaining the city’s infrastructure and working the fields.

**Key Features**:  
- **The Oasis of Flames**: A holy and fertile oasis created by the Great Prophet through contracts with devils.
- **Religious Pilgrimage**: Al-Qahur is the center of the Ahl-e-Ahd faith, attracting millions of pilgrims.
- **Severe Contract Laws**: Breaches of contracts are met with extreme punishments, especially for outsiders and slaves.

**Influence**:  
Al-Qahur is the most **spiritually significant** caliphate and wields enormous **religious influence** over the Ahl-e-Ahd empire. Its economic power from **pilgrimages** and the fertile **Oasis of Flames** ensures its continued dominance.

**Overview**:  
The **Emirate of Zanthir** is the last **major Ahl-e-Ahd stronghold** in the southern territories, located in the **Serron Archipelago**.

The people of Zanthir are fiercely loyal to the **Ahl-e-Ahd religion**, though they have developed a more **pragmatic view** of contract law, using it as a tool to maintain their grip on conquered lands.

The emirate has been fighting a long, drawn-out war against the **Thalmyric Empire**, as the empire seeks to retake the Velian States in their **reconquest** efforts. Despite this, Zanthir remains a vital player in the Ahl-e-Ahd empire, serving as both a **military power** and a **strategic stronghold** against the forces of the Thalmyric Empire.

The **slavery** system in Zanthir is brutal, with entire communities in the **Velian States** forced into bondage under Ahl-e-Ahd rule. The Emir of Zanthir has implemented strict measures to prevent rebellion, though resistance from the local population is constant.

- **Wealthy Port City**: Qabir is a hub of **trade and piracy**, ensuring the emirate’s wealth.
- **Resistance and Rebellion**: The Velian States under Zanthir’s rule are a hotbed of **rebellion**, with locals resisting Ahl-e-Ahd dominance.

**Influence**:  
Zanthir is a key player in the ongoing war with the **Thalmyric Empire**, and its **wealth from trade** and **military strength** make it a crucial part of the Ahl-e-Ahd empire’s efforts to maintain control of the **Velian States**.

### **4. The Caliphate of Qazmarid**

**Inspiration**: Fatimid Caliphate  
**Capital**: **Qazmarid**

**Ruling Class**: The **House of Shahmir**, a noble family known for its military and political prowess.

**Overview**:  
The **Caliphate of Qazmarid** is located on the **eastern borders** of the Ahl-e-Ahd empire, where it has been engaged in a long and brutal border war with the **Kingdom of Veridun** from the **Thalmyric Empire**. Qazmarid is a **militaristic** state, and its caliphate has long served as the **first line of defense** against the eastern powers. The **House of Shahmir**, which rules the caliphate, has earned a reputation for its **strategic genius** and its ruthless enforcement of **contract law**.

Qazmarid’s society revolves around **military service**, and many of its citizens are conscripted into the army. The caliphate’s economy is heavily reliant on **slavery**, particularly of **war prisoners** and **non-Ahl-e-Ahd** individuals, who are used to bolster the region’s defenses and work the lands. Outsiders who are captured by the Qazmarids are treated as **property**, and only the wealthiest have the means to **buy their freedom**.

The border wars with Veridun have turned Qazmarid into a **battleground**, with constant skirmishes and raids shaping daily life in the region. Despite this, the caliphate has managed to thrive, using its position on the front lines to extract **tribute** and **mercenary contracts** from other Ahl-e-Ahd states.
