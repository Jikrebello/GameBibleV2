(Meaning "The Way of the Covenant" or "The Path of the Contract")

### **Founding Story**
The religion of **Al-Ahdiya** was founded by a prophet known as **Mujalib**, who lived centuries ago among the desert-dwelling Ahl-e-Ahd. Mujalib was an ordinary contract scribe, but during a meditation fast in the deep desert, he was visited by a radiant angelic being known as **Malak al-Ahd** (Angel of the Covenant). The angel revealed to him the divine art of **contract binding**, teaching him the secrets of crafting cosmic agreements and the laws that governed all existence.

### **The Revelation**
Mujalib received a series of revelations from **Malak al-Ahd**, which were later recorded as sacred texts known as the **Kitab al-‘Ahd** (Book of the Covenant). These revelations explained that the world itself was bound by the **Great Covenant**—an eternal, divine contract between the Creator and all beings, mortal and divine. The power of contracts was given to humanity as a tool to shape their destinies and elevate themselves toward divine authority.

### **Core Beliefs**
1. **The Great Covenant**: All of existence operates under the divine contract set by the Creator. Every person, spirit, and devil is bound by this covenant, whether they know it or not. The Great Covenant governs not only the laws of nature but also morality, politics, and spiritual life.
   
2. **Contract as Divine Gift**: The ability to write, bind, and enforce contracts is a sacred gift bestowed upon humanity. Those who can master this art are fulfilling their divine purpose. Mastery of contract binding is the highest form of worship, and a righteous contract is seen as a prayer written in legal terms.

3. **Slavery and Servitude**: The concept of slavery is deeply entwined with the religion. Capturing enemies and forcing them into servitude through contracts is seen as a righteous act, as long as the contracts are fulfilled according to their terms. Even the most powerful spirits, devils, and elementals can be enslaved through contracts, reflecting the divine order.
   
4. **Polygamy as a Reflection of Wealth and Power**: The faith promotes **polygamy** as a reflection of one’s ability to manage complex contracts. A man’s wives are bound to him through sacred contracts, and having multiple wives is seen as a sign of prosperity and divine favor. Each marriage contract is considered a covenant that elevates the family.

5. **War as Sacred Contract (Jihad)**: War, known as **Al-Jihad al-Mu'ahad** (The Contracted Struggle), is seen as a divine method for spreading the knowledge of contract binding and fulfilling the divine order. The faithful are encouraged to wage war against those who do not accept the binding nature of the Great Covenant. Captured enemies can be converted to the faith through contracts of servitude, effectively becoming part of the community.
   
6. **Janissary System (The Ahdanite Guard)**: A **janissary-like institution** known as the **Ahdanite Guard** is a core feature of the religion. Children of slaves or captured enemies are raised in the faith, trained in the art of contracts and warfare, and become elite warriors who serve both the religious and political leaders. These warriors are bound by unbreakable oaths to their masters, serving with absolute loyalty until their contracts expire or are fulfilled.

7. **Purity and the Body**: The alignment of **body, mind, and soul** is crucial for crafting contracts of immense power. Dietary laws are strict, focusing on **purity of food** to purify the contract maker. Eating impure foods weakens one’s ability to make effective contracts and is seen as a spiritual failing.

8. **The Mark of the Breach**: Breaking a contract is the greatest sin within Al-Ahdiya. Those who breach contracts are marked with a visible brand, known as the **Mark of the Breach**, and are socially ostracized. This brand is considered a visible sign of their failure to uphold the divine covenant, and only through severe penance or fulfilling new contracts can one hope to erase the mark.

### **Key Tenets**
1. **The Sanctity of Contracts**: A contract, especially one signed in blood, is sacred and must be fulfilled to the letter. The spirit of the law is irrelevant; only the **literal words** matter. 
2. **Mastery of Language**: The most devout believers of Al-Ahdiya dedicate their lives to mastering the intricacies of language, finding clever ways to twist and bind contracts in their favor. Wordcraft is a form of divine art.
3. **Divine Slavery**: Slavery is a sacred institution that reflects the cosmic order. The enslavement of others is justified by the divine contracts, and slaves are considered to be fulfilling their destined roles. However, slaves have the potential to earn freedom through service and the fulfillment of contracts.
4. **Alignment of Body, Mind, and Soul**: Eating pure foods, practicing meditation, and focusing the mind are all critical for maintaining the balance necessary for creating powerful contracts. Those who are spiritually impure or weak in body are less capable of binding significant contracts.
5. **Cunning and Cleverness**: The faithful are encouraged to be clever and resourceful in their dealings. Outwitting an opponent in a contract negotiation is seen as virtuous, as long as the literal terms are adhered to.

### **Religious Practices**
1. **Contract Rituals**: Worship involves elaborate **contract-signing rituals**, where participants sign their agreements in blood before the congregation. These contracts can be personal, business-related, or spiritual oaths. Rituals are often performed at sunrise or sunset, symbolizing the beginning or end of a cosmic cycle.
   
2. **Prayer as Recitation of Contracts**: Daily prayers involve the **recitation of key clauses** from the sacred texts. Believers speak these prayers to reaffirm their commitment to the divine contracts of the Great Covenant.

3. **Fasting and Purification**: Before important contracts are signed, individuals undergo **purification rituals**, which involve fasting from impure foods and drinking only water, symbolizing the cleansing of the body and soul in preparation for sacred agreements.

4. **Pilgrimage to the Desert Temple**: Every believer is expected to make a pilgrimage to the **Temple of the Covenant**, located deep in the desert. The temple is said to house the **original contract scrolls** given to Mujalib by Malak al-Ahd, and it is considered the holiest site for followers of Al-Ahdiya.

### **Hierarchy of the Faith**
1. **The Supreme Arbiter**: The head of the faith is the **Supreme Arbiter**, a spiritual and legal leader who is believed to be the final authority on the interpretation of contracts, both divine and worldly. The Supreme Arbiter is seen as the closest to Mujalib's divine lineage.
   
2. **The Contract Masters**: Beneath the Supreme Arbiter are the **Contract Masters**, individuals who have proven their mastery over contract law and are responsible for enforcing the faith's teachings and legal systems across the land.

3. **The Ahdanite Guard**: The elite warrior-priests of the faith, raised from childhood to serve as the defenders of the Covenant. They are bound to their leaders through sacred oaths that cannot be broken.

4. **Scholars of the Covenant**: These scholars spend their lives studying the **Kitab al-‘Ahd** and interpreting the intricacies of its teachings. They are responsible for drafting contracts on behalf of the faithful and offering legal guidance.
