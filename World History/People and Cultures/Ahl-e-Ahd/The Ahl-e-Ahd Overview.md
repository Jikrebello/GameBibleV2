#### **Geography and Environment**
The **Ahl-e-Ahd** are a desert-dwelling people, living in a harsh and arid environment that has shaped their culture, economy, and philosophy. Their cities are often built around **oases** or hidden sources of water, with tall, imposing architecture designed to reflect the permanence and rigidity of their contract-based society. The desert itself is seen as a vast, untamed space where life is unpredictable, and survival depends on careful planning and negotiation with nature—much like the contracts that bind their world together.

### **Society and Social Structure**
The Ahl-e-Ahd are a **highly stratified society**, with social status determined largely by one’s ability to navigate the intricate web of contracts that underpin every aspect of life. The most powerful individuals are the **Contract Masters**, who are skilled at crafting binding agreements that can control not only people but also supernatural entities, such as devils and elemental spirits.

1. **The Elite**: At the top of society are those who are **gifted in contract creation**—lawyers, scribes, and contract magicians. These individuals hold significant political and economic power, as they control the contracts that govern trade, alliances, and even the enslavement of lesser beings.

2. **Merchants and Traders**: Below the elite are the **merchants and traders**, who play a vital role in the economy. Their wealth is derived from their ability to negotiate favorable trade agreements and exploit loopholes in international deals. The Ahl-e-Ahd are known for their cunning in diplomacy and business, often creating contracts that seem favorable but contain hidden clauses to benefit themselves.

3. **Slaves and Servants**: The lower classes and **slaves** form the backbone of the Ahl-e-Ahd economy. Slaves are often bound to service through contracts that they or their ancestors signed or through military conquest. A significant portion of the population consists of captured enemies and their descendants, who are forced into servitude through **magical contracts** that cannot be easily broken.

4. **Golems and Bound Spirits**: The Ahl-e-Ahd also make extensive use of **golems**—automatons created by binding powerful devils or elemental spirits into clay or stone bodies. These golems are used for labor, industry, and warfare, and their contracts are among the most powerful, often involving dangerous rituals and blood oaths.

5. **The Ahdanite Guard**: A warrior caste known as the **Ahdanite Guard** serves both as the military force and protectors of the elite. These warriors are often raised from the children of slaves or lower classes, bound into lifelong service through contracts that ensure their loyalty. They are highly skilled and feared for their abilities in both combat and contract enforcement.

### **Religion: [[Al-Ahdiya Overview]]**
The religion of the Ahl-e-Ahd, known as **Al-Ahdiya**, is central to their worldview and permeates all aspects of life. It is a **contract-based faith**, centered around the teachings of the prophet **Mujalib**, who received divine knowledge from the angel **Malak al-Ahd**.

1. **The Great Covenant**: The Ahl-e-Ahd believe that the universe itself is governed by the **Great Covenant**, a divine contract that binds all of creation to certain laws. Their religion teaches that the **ability to bind others to contracts** is a gift from the gods, and those who can master this art are closest to divine power.

2. **Sacred Contracts**: Written contracts, especially those signed in blood, are considered sacred. Breaching a contract is the gravest sin in their religion, often resulting in **physical and spiritual punishment**, such as being branded with the **Mark of the Breach**.

3. **War and Slavery**: The faith encourages **jihad** (holy war) to expand the influence of the Great Covenant. Captured enemies are often enslaved and bound to contracts of servitude, while their children may be trained as the next generation of warriors or scholars.

4. **Polygamy and Social Contracts**: Marriage in the Ahl-e-Ahd society is also governed by contracts, and **polygamy** is seen as a reflection of one’s ability to maintain multiple complex agreements. Each marriage is a covenant, with its own set of rights and responsibilities.
