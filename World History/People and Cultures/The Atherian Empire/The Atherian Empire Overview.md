### The Predecessors of Eclessia, the Thalmyric Empire, and the Sestaran Peninsula

The **Atherians** were a mighty empire that stretched across the lands now held by Eclessia, the Thalmyric Empire, and the Sestaran Peninsula. This vast empire was known for its monumental achievements in governance, engineering, military prowess, and culture. They constructed grand cities, intricate road networks, aqueducts, temples, and monuments that still stand in ruins today, serving as a testament to their greatness. Their capital was located in what is now the Thalmyric Empire, marking the origin of their vast influence before they expanded westward.

The **Atherian Empire** was deeply tied to its **Star Pantheon**, a collection of gods and goddesses whose constellations and celestial appearances guided the Atherians through their lives, wars, and spiritual pursuits. This celestial worship, combined with the Atherian belief in destiny shaped by the stars, formed the backbone of their cultural and religious life.

### **Atherian Influence on the Present**

#### **Eclessia**:
The remnants of the **Atherian Empire** in former province of Eclessia are few, but their roads, aqueducts, and ruins can still be found, particularly in the eastern regions. The empire's administrative and military structure heavily influenced the early formation of the kingdoms that now reside inside Eclessia.

#### **The Thalmyric Empire**:
As the **Atherians** originated from the region now held by the **Thalmyric Empire**, their influence is most profound here. Atherian roads, public works, and architecture remain in use, and the Star Pantheon still holds sway in some regions, despite the Astratheon religion being banned and outlawed. The **Thalmyric Empire** considers itself the true successor to the **Atherian Empire**, preserving its traditions and grandeur, despite its conversion to the Eclessian Faith.

#### **The Sestaran Peninsula**:
The city-states of the **The Sestaran Peninsula** hold onto the cultural legacy of the **Atherians**, especially in their art, philosophy, and politics. Many of the **Sestaran Cities’s** most famous philosophers and artists draw inspiration from **Atherian** thought and their belief in destiny guided by the stars. Ruins of ancient Atherian temples and forums are scattered across these lands, with some city-states still using old Atherian infrastructure.
