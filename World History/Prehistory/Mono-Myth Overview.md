#### **1. Creation and the Fall of Humanity**

In the earliest days, when the world was still young and untouched by corruption, humanity lived in a state of grace. The Lord, a divine and incomprehensible force, had crafted them as the pinnacle of creation, destined to one day inherit the earth and guide it with wisdom and love. Humanity was given dominion over the earth, not to rule it as tyrants, but as stewards who would nurture and cultivate the land in harmony with the divine order.

However, the creation of humanity ignited a deep-seated jealousy within a being known as the **Adversary**. Once a being of light and power, the Adversary could not abide the thought of lesser beings surpassing him and his kin in the Lord’s favor. This jealousy sowed the seeds of rebellion, and the Adversary, along with many other celestial beings, waged war against the Lord’s host. This became known as the **Great Rebellion in Heaven**.

During this rebellion, the ranks of the Adversary’s followers fractured. One group, known as the **Menhir**, sought refuge in the natural forces of the world, bonding themselves to elemental powers and the primal forces of nature. Another faction, the **Idols**, turned their eyes to the newly revealed **Dreamlands**, a vast metaphysical plane where the collective subconscious of all sentient beings resided, seeking dominion over these realms.

The rebellion ultimately failed, with the Adversary and his followers cast down and exiled into the **Abyss**, but not before they enacted a final betrayal: corrupting humanity. Through deceit, they convinced humans to rebel against the Lord’s commandments, leading to the fall of humanity from grace. The paradise they once knew was lost, and the world became a **battleground** where good and evil now coexisted, pulling humanity in opposing directions.

#### **2. The Age of the Giants and the Tyranny of the False Gods**

In this fractured world, the Menhir and the Idols saw an opportunity. They bound themselves to the earth, sky, seas, and the Dreamlands, solidifying their power and cutting themselves off from the Adversary’s punishment. They procreated with humanity, producing a race of powerful hybrid beings—the **Giants**. These Giants established their own empires and ruled over the humans with divine authority, claiming themselves as the gods of the world.

The **Giants** enslaved humanity, using them as labor, sacrifices, and worshipers. Each empire was distinct in its cruelty:

- **Qianglong**: The Giants of Qianglong, children of the **Four Horsemen**, ruled with terrifying discipline. They governed over cycles of war, death, famine, and pestilence, seeing themselves as custodians of the world's natural order. Their empire spanned lush valleys and sacred peaks, where they built towering fortresses and demanded absolute obedience.

- **Ishkatar**: The **Serpent Giants** of Ishkatar, with their serpentine lower bodies and humanoid upper forms, ruled through greed and fear. Children of the **Idol of Greed**, they demanded endless sacrifices of wealth, treasure, and life to maintain their empire’s prosperity. Their pyramids dominated the riverbanks of their desert kingdom, monuments to their insatiable hunger for power.

- **Xolotl**: In the jungles of Xolotl, the **Obsidian Giants**, born of the **Idol of Wrath**, ruled through bloodshed and ritual sacrifice. They demanded the blood of their subjects, offering hearts and lives to power the **Blood Sun**, a dark and terrible creation that hovered above their capital. Their empire was a testament to violence and death, sustained by constant human offerings.

- **Nythalum**: On a distant island, the **Techno-Giants** of Nythalum, children of **Mother Moon** and the **Star Child**, sought to transcend mortality itself. They blended magic and technology to create towering machines and spires that reached toward the heavens, aiming to ascend to the stars. They enslaved humanity to build their great works, believing themselves destined to join the celestial realm.

Each empire represented a different form of tyranny, but all shared a common element: humanity was enslaved, sacrificed, or treated as mere pawns in the Giants’ pursuit of power.

#### **3. The Calling of the Great Prophet**

After centuries of oppression, the Lord chose a single human—a **Great Prophet**—to rise up and deliver humanity from the clutches of the Giants. This prophet, humble and uncertain, was initially hesitant. Nevertheless, the Lord imbued him with divine power and tasked him with spreading His word and leading the people out of bondage.

The Prophet’s journey took him through each of the Giant empires, where he faced intense resistance. The Giants refused to relinquish their control, but the Lord’s power flowed through the Prophet, allowing him to unleash terrible plagues and divine calamities upon the Giants:

- In **Qianglong**, the Prophet’s miracles unbalanced the natural forces, bringing famine, disease, and ruin to the empire’s structured harmony.
- In **Ishkatar**, the Prophet’s divine intervention dried up the rivers and turned their treasures to dust, breaking the power of the Serpent Giants.
- In **Xolotl**, the **Blood Sun** exploded in a volcanic eruption after the Prophet called down the Lord’s judgment, obliterating the Obsidian Giants' capital and ending their bloody reign.
- In **Nythalum**, the Prophet’s prayers brought down the spires, collapsing their ascent into the heavens and leaving the few who reached the moon stranded as disembodied minds.

As the Prophet moved through the lands, those who believed in his message joined him, forming a growing exodus of freed peoples. Those who did not believe remained behind, many perishing in the chaos or joining in slave rebellions that toppled the Giants’ empires from within.

#### **4. The Crossing of the Great Glass Desert**

With the Giants’ empires in ruins, the Prophet gathered the surviving humans and led them south toward a new destiny. Their path took them to the **Great Glass Desert**, a vast and shimmering expanse of glass-like sands created by ancient, unknown forces. The desert was as treacherous as it was beautiful, with its glittering surface hiding deadly dangers beneath.

The Lord commanded the Prophet to lead the people to a sanctuary on the far side of the desert—a place where they would settle for **three generations**, strengthening their faith and preparing for the journey to the **promised land**. However, the Prophet, weary from years of struggle, chose to disobey. He believed that delaying the journey would harm the people more than help them. Instead of leading them to the sanctuary, he pressed on, determined to reach the promised land as quickly as possible.

#### **5. The Prophet’s Death and the Scattering of the Tribes**

This act of disobedience cost the Prophet his life. As the exodus neared the edge of the **promised land**, a great calamity struck—possibly a divine punishment/ the natural consequence of rushing ahead without the Lord’s blessing or as some say, murdered by those closest to him. The Prophet was consumed by a violent storm in the desert, his body lost to the sands.

With the Prophet’s death, the unity of the people shattered. Without their leader and the direct guidance of the Lord, they quarreled among themselves, their common cause lost. The exodus fractured into many groups, each going its own way.

#### **6. The Birth of New Cultures**

As the people crossed into the southern lands, they settled into distinct regions and began to form new cultures, each carrying remnants of the Prophet’s teachings but diverging in their beliefs and practices:

- **The Ahl-e-Ahd** wandered the **Great Desert** for generations, forming small nomadic tribes. Over time, the story of the Lord and the Prophet became distorted through generations of oral retellings. Eventually, a **Final Prophet** arose, claiming to have been visited by an angel of the Lord. This angel taught him that the world and all of existence were governed by **cosmic contracts**, and he learned to write his own. He founded the **Caliphate of Al-Qahur**, forging contracts with spiritual entities, including the **4444 devils** who dug the oasis that sustains the city to this day. Al-Qahur became the spiritual heart of the **Al-Ahdiya** faith, and millions make pilgrimages there to honor the Final Prophet’s teachings.

- **The Atherians**, though once followers of the Great Prophet, fell back into old ways, worshiping the **Idols** and **Menhir** as gods. Their descendants formed mighty city-states, driven by power and ambition, with little memory of the Lord's commandments.

- **The Fäskogarfolk** split into two distinct groups: the **Ättar**, who became a proud and warlike people bound to nature, and the **Enaidfae**, who blended spiritualism with a reverence for natural forces. Both groups retained elements of the **Menhir** in their beliefs, focusing on nature’s raw power rather than the Lord.

- **The Jirahar**, unlike the others, remained faithful to the Great Prophet’s original teachings. They rejected the idea of a permanent home, believing they were still in search of the true promised land. They became a nomadic people, forming **caravans** and **tower towns**, always on the move, following the paths of their ancestors in an unending quest for the divine promise.

### **7. Forgotten North and the New World**

To this day, no one knows what became of the lands north of the **Great Glass Desert**. The empires of the Giants have long since crumbled, their ruins swallowed by time and the sands of history. A few brave sea-farers claim to have ventured across the **Boiling Sea**, surviving the deadly hurricanes at the equator to reach the northern hemisphere. There, they report encountering strange and alien lands, hinting at a **new world** that lies waiting to be rediscovered.
