### Overview

Nythalum was a highly advanced and isolated civilization of Giants located on a large, secluded island in the middle of the world’s vast ocean. Renowned for their unparalleled intellect, magical prowess, and technological achievements, the Giants of Nythalum were known as the **Forgotten Ones**—beings who sought to transcend their physical forms and ascend to a higher plane of existence. Their civilization was marked by a deep reverence for both **Lyraxis**, the Star Child of Music, Trickery, and Inspiration, and **Lunara**, Mother Moon, the Menhir of Chaos, Transformation, and Enlightenment. The culmination of their ambitions led to the catastrophic failure of the **Ascension Project**, which resulted in the destruction of their homeland and their transformation into disembodied, machine-bound minds.

### Geography

Nythalum was situated on a lush, fertile island, surrounded by deep, mysterious oceans. The island was characterized by its towering crystal cities, dense jungles, and serene, moonlit beaches. The heart of Nythalum’s civilization was the capital city, **Lunarasyl**, a grand metropolis built around massive, gleaming spires that reached towards the heavens. These spires were both symbols of their devotion to Lunara and functional rocket ships intended to carry the Giants to the moon.

The island itself was rich in magical resources, with ley lines of potent energy crisscrossing beneath its surface, which the Forgotten Ones tapped into to power their advanced technology and arcane rituals. The proximity to these natural sources of power further fueled their ambitious projects and their quest for transcendence.

### The Forgotten Ones: Rulers and Their Beliefs

The ruling Giants of Nythalum, known as the **Forgotten Ones**, were a race of immensely tall, slender beings with elongated limbs and heads. Their appearance was heavily modified with advanced magical and technological enhancements, giving them an almost alien, otherworldly presence. They were the descendants of Lyraxis, whose influence imbued them with an insatiable thirst for knowledge, creativity, and a deep understanding of the cosmos.

However, it was their veneration of **Lunara, Mother Moon**, that truly defined their civilization. They believed that the moon was a sacred realm, a place where the barriers between the material and the divine were weakest. The moon represented the ultimate destination for their souls—a place where they could shed their physical forms and become beings of pure intellect, guided by Lunara’s chaotic and transformative light.

The Forgotten Ones saw their physical forms as temporary vessels, something to be transcended in their pursuit of higher understanding and communion with Lunara. Their society was built around this belief, with every aspect of their culture, from their art to their science, focused on achieving the ultimate goal of lunar ascension.

### Culture and Religion

Nythalum was a deeply spiritual and intellectual society. The Forgotten Ones held elaborate rituals and ceremonies that combined magic and technology, often aligning these events with significant lunar phases and celestial events. These rituals were designed to honor both Lyraxis and Lunara, with the ultimate goal of gaining Lunara’s favor for their journey to the moon.

Their religion was less about traditional worship and more about a philosophical pursuit of enlightenment through the merging of magic and technology. The Forgotten Ones believed that by understanding and mastering the natural and supernatural laws of the universe, they could transcend mortality and join Lunara in her realm of endless transformation.

The civilization also placed a high value on creativity and innovation. Artistic expression was considered a form of worship, with the greatest works of art being those that captured the essence of Lunara’s chaotic beauty or Lyraxis’s inspirational trickery. Music, in particular, was highly revered, and it was said that the Forgotten Ones could create harmonies that resonated with the very fabric of the cosmos.

### The Ascension Project

The **Ascension Project** was the pinnacle of Nythalum’s achievements and the ultimate expression of their desire to transcend the material world. The project involved the construction of massive spires that served as both architectural marvels and advanced rocket ships. These spires were designed to launch entire cities of Giants into space, with the moon as their destination.

The Forgotten Ones believed that upon reaching the moon, they would be able to shed their physical forms and live as beings of pure intellect, in perfect harmony with Lunara’s divine light. The project was a massive undertaking, requiring the combined knowledge of Nythalum’s greatest minds in magic, technology, and spiritual practice.

However, the project ended in disaster. As the spires launched, catastrophic malfunctions occurred, causing most of them to explode mid-flight. The explosions triggered massive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, which ultimately led to the island sinking into the ocean. The few spires that succeeded in reaching the moon carried the last survivors of the Forgotten Ones, who, unable to survive in their physical forms, uploaded their consciousnesses into the computers of their ships.

### The Moonbound: The Transformation and Return

The Forgotten Ones who reached the moon were forever changed. Stranded on a barren, lifeless world, they realized that their physical bodies could not survive the harsh conditions. In a desperate act of survival, they transferred their consciousnesses into the ship’s computers, becoming disembodied minds trapped within a vast network of cold, unfeeling machines.

Over eons, these beings, now more machine than mind, continued to exist in their **Moonbase**—a sprawling complex of interconnected machines, data archives, and laboratories on the moon’s surface. Cut off from the material world, they became obsessed with their failed project, driven by a desire to reclaim what they had lost.

In recent times, smaller vessels from the Moonbase have returned to the planet, carrying the minds of the Forgotten Ones housed in **Constructs**—terrifying, mechanical bodies that blend metal with organic matter. These Constructs are cold, calculating beings that feel no pain, show no mercy, and pursue incomprehensible goals.

### Legacy and Myth

The story of Nythalum and the Ascension Project became one of the great myths of the world, a tale of hubris, ambition, and the dangers of reaching too far. The island itself is now lost beneath the ocean, its ruins hidden in the depths, with strange lights occasionally seen in the waters above where the island once stood.

The **Constructs** of the Forgotten Ones have become figures of terror in the mortal world. These mechanical horrors are often seen as harbingers of doom or omens of great change, their motives inscrutable and their power terrifying. Scholars debate their purpose, with some believing they seek to complete their ascension by any means necessary, while others fear they are bent on revenge for their failure.

The Moonbase remains a place of mystery and dread, with its exact location on the moon unknown. It is said to be a cold, silent place, filled with the whispers of the disembodied minds that dwell there, forever plotting and planning their return to the world they once sought to leave behind.

In the end, the Forgotten Ones of Nythalum stand as a cautionary tale of the dangers of unchecked ambition and the pursuit of power at the expense of all else. Their legacy, both on the moon and in the myths of the world, serves as a reminder that some dreams are better left unfulfilled.
