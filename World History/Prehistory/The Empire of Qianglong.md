### Overview

The Celestial Empire of Qianglong was a powerful and ancient civilization, structured around four distinct castes of Giants, each representing one of the Four Horsemen—**Solrath (War), Nevaura (Famine), Morvalis (Death),** and **Veradia (Pestilence)**. These castes, embodying the attributes of their divine progenitors, formed the backbone of Qianglong society and governance. The Menhir/Horsemen themselves, after shaping the early prehistory of the world, took a step back, allowing their giant offspring to lead the empire on their behalf. The history of Qianglong was marked by grand civil wars, with each victorious caste establishing a new dynasty, only to be replaced in time by another, reflecting the cyclical nature of power.

### The Four Castes of Giants

**1. The War Caste: Children of Solrath**

- **Role:** The War Caste was responsible for the empire's military might. These Giants were the generals, warriors, and strategists who led Qianglong’s armies in conquest and defense. They were known for their unmatched strength, discipline, and tactical brilliance.
- **Appearance:** Towering, muscular Giants clad in blood-red armor that radiated heat. Their eyes burned with the intensity of the sun, and they carried weapons that seemed to pulse with destructive power.
- **Domain:** The War Caste controlled the empire’s fortifications, military academies, and the lands surrounding the capital city, where the empire’s elite soldiers were trained.
- **Dynastic Influence:** The War Caste often rose to power during periods of conflict, establishing dynasties that prioritized conquest and expansion. Their reigns were marked by the consolidation of power and the strengthening of the empire’s borders.

**2. The Famine Caste: Children of Nevaura**

- **Role:** The Famine Caste governed the agricultural and economic aspects of the empire. These Giants oversaw the distribution of resources, ensuring that the empire could survive through harsh winters and times of scarcity.
- **Appearance:** Gaunt, pale Giants with frost-covered skin. Their breath chilled the air, and their presence could cause crops to wither and rivers to freeze.
- **Domain:** The Famine Caste controlled the empire’s farmlands, granaries, and trade routes. They were also responsible for managing the empire’s vast reserves of food and wealth.
- **Dynastic Influence:** The Famine Caste rose to power during times of economic hardship or natural disasters, establishing dynasties that focused on stability, resource management, and survival. Their reigns were characterized by austerity and strict control over the empire’s resources.

**3. The Death Caste: Children of Morvalis**

- **Role:** The Death Caste managed the spiritual and necromantic aspects of Qianglong society. These Giants were the priests, morticians, and necromancers who maintained the balance between life and death, ensuring that the dead were honored and the living were guided.
- **Appearance:** Skeletal Giants draped in rust-colored armor and tattered cloaks. Their eyes glowed with a ghostly light, and their presence brought an aura of decay and inevitability.
- **Domain:** The Death Caste controlled the empire’s temples, cemeteries, and necropolises. They were also the keepers of Qianglong’s extensive funerary rites and necromantic practices.
- **Dynastic Influence:** The Death Caste often rose to power during times of spiritual unrest or when the balance between life and death was threatened. Their dynasties focused on maintaining cosmic order, respecting the cycles of life, and mastering necromantic arts. Their reigns were often marked by a deep reverence for tradition and the ancestors.

**4. The Pestilence Caste: Children of Veradia**

- **Role:** The Pestilence Caste was responsible for the empire’s knowledge of herbalism, medicine, and the management of disease. These Giants were both healers and bringers of plague, using their knowledge to control the balance between life and decay.
- **Appearance:** Vines and creeping plants grew from their bodies, with their skin displaying mottled, diseased patches. Their eyes gleamed with a toxic green light, and their breath carried the scent of rot and new growth.
- **Domain:** The Pestilence Caste controlled the empire’s swamps, jungles, and medicinal gardens. They were also in charge of Qianglong’s vast apothecaries and the study of both healing and poisons.
- **Dynastic Influence:** The Pestilence Caste rose to power during times of widespread illness or environmental crisis, establishing dynasties that emphasized the duality of growth and decay. Their reigns were often marked by significant advancements in medicine and agriculture, as well as a deep connection to the natural world.

### The Dynastic Cycle

The history of the Celestial Empire of Qianglong was defined by a cyclical pattern of dynastic rise and fall, closely tied to the attributes of the ruling caste. When one caste grew too powerful or became corrupt, the other castes would unite to overthrow them, leading to a grand civil war. The victorious caste would then establish a new dynasty, reshaping the empire according to their values and strengths.

- **War Dynasties:** Characterized by military expansion, conquest, and the strengthening of the empire’s defenses. These dynasties often left the empire with vast territories but also brought the strain of constant warfare.

- **Famine Dynasties:** Focused on stability, resource management, and economic growth. These dynasties often led the empire through periods of recovery and rebuilding, but their strict control sometimes led to stagnation and internal unrest.

- **Death Dynasties:** Emphasized spiritual order, tradition, and the balance between life and death. These dynasties often brought peace and stability but were also known for their conservatism and resistance to change.

- **Pestilence Dynasties:** Known for their advancements in medicine, agriculture, and the balance between growth and decay. These dynasties often brought innovation and environmental harmony but also faced challenges related to disease and the management of natural resources.

### The Disappearance of the Giants and the Fall of Qianglong

As the cycles continued, the influence of the Horsemen began to weigh heavily on the empire. The Giants, increasingly divided by their caste loyalties and ambitions, found themselves in a constant state of conflict. The final dynastic war, the **War of the Four Horsemen**, saw the castes tear each other apart in a struggle for supremacy.

In the aftermath, the ruling Giants—sensing the impending collapse—retreated into vast underground vaults hidden beneath the mountains. These vaults were said to contain the greatest treasures and knowledge of each caste, as well as powerful relics tied to the Horsemen themselves. With their rulers gone, the lesser Giants and humans of the empire descended into chaos, unable to maintain the fragile balance that had kept the civilization intact.

The once-great cities of Qianglong were abandoned, their temples and palaces left to decay as the empire fell into ruin. The remnants of Qianglong are now haunted places, filled with the echoes of past grandeur and the dark magic that still lingers in the bones of the earth.

The legacy of the Celestial Empire of Qianglong lives on in the myths and legends of the world, a tale of power, ambition, and the inevitable decay that comes when the forces of War, Famine, Death, and Pestilence are allowed to rule unchecked.
