### **House of Soran: Origins and Rise to Power**

The **House of Soran**, despite its current status as the ruling family of **Aversia** and one of the most powerful noble houses in the **Sestaran Concord**, is a relatively **new player** in the region’s political landscape. The Sorans began as a **traveling mercenary band**, a ragtag group of professional soldiers-for-hire led by **Gaius Bellori**, the great-grandfather of the current Duke Marcus Soran. Over the course of a few generations, they transformed from a **mercenary outfit** into a powerful **political dynasty**—a rise marked by **ruthless cunning**, **strategic alliances**, and a **prolonged civil war** within Aversia.

#### **The Mercenary Beginnings**

The story of the **Soran family** began with **Gaius Bellori**, a charismatic and battle-hardened mercenary captain who built a reputation for leading his band of soldiers through the conflicts and wars that riddled the region during the chaotic final years of the **Atherian Empire**. Known for his **tactical genius** and ability to turn even the most dire situations in his favour, Gaius began to accumulate wealth and influence by offering the services of his **mercenary band** the **Iron Wolves** to city-states and nobles in need of military assistance and soon became famous for their **discipline** and ability to turn the tide of battle for whoever could afford their services

Over the decades, the Iron Wolves gained a reputation for their **brutality** in combat and their **ruthless efficiency** in dealing with both enemies and clients. Gaius believed that **loyalty was earned by fear and respect**, and his mercenaries followed his code. By the time he was an old man, Gaius had amassed a significant fortune, and his mercenaries were considered among the most elite in the Concord

As the **Sestaran Concord** fractured into independent city-states, Aversia became embroiled in its own **internal power struggles**, with several noble families vying for control of the city’s wealth and its strategic iron mines. It was during this period of civil unrest that the Iron Wolves, now led by Gaius’s son, **Valerius Bellori**, was hired by various factions to fight on their behalf.

#### **The Civil War in Aversia**

It was during the life of Gaius's son, **Valerius Bellori**, that the **Iron Wolves** transitioned from a mercenary company to the rulers of the city of Aversia. **Aversia**, at that time, was a fractured city-state ruled by three **feuding noble families**, **House Verati**, **House Carvonius**, and **House Soran** each vying for control of the city’s **iron mines** and **steelworks**, which were the lifeblood of the region. The Iron Wolves were hired by various factions at different times to fight in this **long, bloody civil war**.

Valerius Bellori, recognizing an opportunity to **rise above the mercenary life** and seize power for his family, began to manipulate the rival noble houses. He played the three **noble factions** against one another, using his role as a neutral party of mercenaries to do work for and against each family while making overtures of loyalty to all sides and having a "its just business" approach. Over time, this **cunning strategy** led to the weakening of all three factions, as each grew increasingly reliant on the Bellori's to survive their wars.

Finally, in a **bold and controversial move**, Valerius **married** the daughter Lady Elara Soran of the weakest noble family, the **Soran family**, who had the least influence but possessed a legitimate noble title. By **taking the name Soran**, Valerius gained the pretense of nobility and the legitimacy he needed to enact the final part of his plan to raise his family to greatness.

### **The Fall of the Noble Houses**

Once the Bellori's (now Soran's) had a foothold in Aversia through their marriage to House Soran, they carefully began dismantling the remaining factions. Valerius (nee Bellori) Soran used his military expertise to deliver crushing blows to **House Carvonius** and **House Verati**, by consolidating his control over the city’s military and economic resources. With the **iron mines** and **steelworks** of Aversia under Soran control, the **mercenary band** was transformed into a professional standing army loyal only to the Soran family.

This takeover was viewed by many as a **betrayal** of traditional noble values, but Valerius’s military success and his control of Aversia’s defenses made him untouchable. The Sorans had transformed from **mercenaries** into **princes**, and Valerius's son, **Marcus Soran**, inherited not only a formidable military force but also the newly formed **Principality of Aversia**.

By the time **Marcus Soran**, son of Valerius, ascended to power, the Sorans had **crushed the rival noble houses** and taken control of the entire city. In a controversial and ruthless move, Marcus executed the remaining members of Houses Verati and Carvonius in a grand public affair that saw both families hanged on mass in the city square, putting an end to their claims on power. The Sorans had officially risen from **mercenaries** to **rulers**, cementing their control over Aversia as the new **principality** under their leadership.
