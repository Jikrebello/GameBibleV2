ill give you all the information and then let you more or less how i imagine this playing out.

The Atherian Empire Overview

The **Atherians** were a mighty empire that stretched across the lands now held by Eclessia, the Thalmyric Empire, and the Sestaran Peninsula. This vast empire was known for its monumental achievements in governance, engineering, military prowess, and culture. They constructed grand cities, intricate road networks, aqueducts, temples, and monuments that still stand in ruins today, serving as a testament to their greatness. Their capital was located in what is now the Thalmyric Empire, marking the origin of their vast influence before they expanded westward.

The **Atherian Empire** was deeply tied to its **Star Pantheon**, a collection of gods and goddesses whose constellations and celestial appearances guided the Atherians through their lives, wars, and spiritual pursuits. This celestial worship, combined with the Atherian belief in destiny shaped by the stars, formed the backbone of their cultural and religious life.

### **Atherian Influence on the Present**

#### **Eclessia**:

The remnants of the **Atherian Empire** in former province of Eclessia are few, but their roads, aqueducts, and ruins can still be found, particularly in the eastern regions. The empire's administrative and military structure heavily influenced the early formation of the kingdoms that now reside inside Eclessia.

#### **The Thalmyric Empire**:

As the **Atherians** originated from the region now held by the **Thalmyric Empire**, their influence is most profound here. Atherian roads, public works, and architecture remain in use, and the Star Pantheon still holds sway in some regions, despite the Astratheon religion being banned and outlawed. The **Thalmyric Empire** considers itself the true successor to the **Atherian Empire**, preserving its traditions and grandeur, despite its conversion to the Eclessian Faith.

#### **The Sestaran Peninsula**:

The city-states of the **The Sestaran Peninsula** hold onto the cultural legacy of the **Atherians**, especially in their art, philosophy, and politics. Many of the **Sestaran Cities’s** most famous philosophers and artists draw inspiration from **Atherian** thought and their belief in destiny guided by the stars. Ruins of ancient Atherian temples and forums are scattered across these lands, with some city-states still using old Atherian infrastructure.

---

### **Legacy of the Atherians**

The **Atherian Empire** may have fallen, but its legacy lives on through the ruins, myths, and practices of the successor states. The starry gods of the **Atherians** still watch over the world, their constellations appearing in the night sky as reminders of a once-great empire and the enduring power of the stars. Though the **Redeemer’s faith** has replaced much of their worship, the influence of the **Atherian** gods, culture, and empire remains deeply embedded in the fabric of the modern world.

The Thalmyric Empire

The **Thalmyric Empire** is a grand and ancient civilization, a direct successor to the once-mighty **Atherian Empire**, which once ruled the known world. Situated along the **Thalassian Sea**, it is a proud nation steeped in tradition, mysticism, and relentless warfare. Once part of the broader **Atherian Empire**, the Thalmyric Empire came to be due to invasion by the Ahl-e-Ahd which lead to the Atherian Empire splitting due to the withdrawal of troops/ manpower and resources from the western part of the empire in order to fight off the invasion in the east, which solidified into the smaller eastern part of the empire as being distinct due because of religious and political tensions and differences between the eastern and western parts of the empire, leading the eastern part to developing its own identity and its version of the faith of the **Redeemer**. While sharing the same core religious beliefs as Eclessia to the west, the Thalmyric interpretation is more mystical and introspective, with a strong focus on divine mysteries and spiritual enlightenment.

The empire faces constant pressure from its southern enemies, the **Ahl-e-Ahd**, and has shaped itself around a culture of **reconquest** to reclaim the lands lost during past invasions. With its strategic location, historical roots in the Atherian Empire, and religious schism, the Thalmyric Empire stands as a powerful and culturally rich civilization, both spiritually driven and militarily focused.

---

### **Historical Background**

The Thalmyric Empire traces its roots to the **Atherian Empire**, once the dominant force in the world. As the Atherian Empire expanded, it grew vast, encompassing what is now **Eclessia**, the **Sestaran Peninsula**, and the lands of the Thalmyric Empire itself. However, as the empire expanded westward, cracks began to form.

When the **Faith of the Redeemer** first arose in the western, less developed regions of the Atherian Empire (now Eclessia), it spread rapidly among the peasantry. Eventually, this faith gained momentum, eventually establishing the **Sanctum Divinitatis** in the small but resource rich Kingdom of Aurelia. The faith was slower to take hold in the more culturally advanced eastern territories, leading to growing tensions between the two regions, however, the Faith of the Redeemer eventually settled to become the dominant religion in both regions, with the outlaw and banning of the old "pagan" religions of Astratheon and the worship of Trium (the 3 bodied god).

The fall of the Atherian Empire eventually led to the region of **Eclessia** falling into an interregnum in the west and the Thalmyric Empire in the east. The **schism** in the faith mirrored the political split, with the **Thalmyric Church** developing its own mystical, introspective interpretation of the Redeemer, while the Eclessian **Sanctum Divinitatis** took on a more worldly and institutional role.

Today, the Thalmyric Empire claims to be the true successor of the Atherian Empire, while the Eclessian church claims that whoever is able to unify the various kingdoms and territories of Eclessia under a single ruler again will be divinely blessed by the church as the true inheritor to the Atherian Empire. The ongoing rivalry between the two churches and their regions is a significant feature of the political landscape, with both sides vying for religious and cultural dominance.

---

### **Religious Schism and the Thalmyric Church**

The **Thalmyric Church** follows the same core beliefs of the **Faith of the Redeemer** as the Eclessian Church but differs significantly in practice and interpretation. The Thalmyric Church is highly mystical, focusing on **personal communion with the divine**, **visions**, and **asceticism**. The schism between the two branches of the faith stems from disagreements over church structure, the role of the clergy, and the interpretation of divine will.

The **Patriarch of Veridun** serves as the highest religious authority in the Thalmyric Church. The church remains deeply intertwined with the imperial government, guiding the emperor in spiritual matters and supporting the empire's ongoing military campaigns against the Ahl-e-Ahd. The **reconquest efforts** to reclaim territories lost to the Ahl-e-Ahd are seen as a **holy duty**, with the church often leading both the spiritual and military charge.

---

### **The Reconquest and Conflict with the Ahl-e-Ahd**

One of the defining features of the Thalmyric Empire is its long-standing conflict with the **Ahl-e-Ahd**, a powerful empire to the south and east that follows a distinct faith centered on **contract-binding magic**. The **Ahl-e-Ahd invasions** began centuries ago, quickly overrunning several key southern territories that include the now named Velian States as well as establishing the **Emirate of Zanthir**. This event set the stage for the Thalmyric Empire’s ongoing **reconquest** efforts, which are as much about spiritual redemption as they are about military victory.

The war with the Ahl-e-Ahd is both a military and religious struggle. The Thalmyric Empire views the reconquest of its southern territories as a **divinely mandated mission**, and the Eastern Church plays a crucial role in framing the conflict as a holy war. However, the Ahl-e-Ahd’s advanced **contract-based magic** and their disciplined slave armies make this a prolonged and grueling struggle. Some of the conquered lands have developed into **blended territories**, where Ahl-e-Ahd influence remains strong despite ongoing Thalmyric resistance.

Eclessia Overview

The region known as **Eclessia** is a vast collection of kingdoms and territories that were all in some way, shape or form once apart of the Atherian Empire before its withdrawal back to the east. It is the origin spot for the Eclessian church and the faith of the **Redeemer** and his teachings is particular strong here, all the way from the peasentry to its nobles and rulers. As a beacon of religious authority and spiritual guidance, it is structured much like medieval Christendom, with strong ties between the church, nobility, and knightly orders. Eclessia is shaped by a deep connection to the Redeemer’s doctrine of faith, self-sacrifice, and divine love, which is contrasted against the remnants of the **Atherian Empire** of old, from which it originally came from. However, it is also currently suffering from an interregnum, with no clear kingdom or ruler able to get a strong enough advantage or collection of alliances to fulfil the churches mandate to once again bring back and rule a second Atherian Empire.

---

### **Historical Context**

Eclessia is the name given to the collection of provinces that all make up the western part of the fallen **Atherian Empire**. It was settled after years of conquest and expansion, and as a result is much more rough, rural and underdeveloped compared to the Thalmyric Empire. The region became destabilized and fell into an interregnum after the Atherian Empire collapsed trying to defend its eastern lands and holdings against the Ahl-e-Ahd and their aggressive expansion into the cultural heartlands of the empire, essentially leaving large swarths of the empire in the west high and dry. This lead to mass banditry and the barbarian Fäskogarfolk to start invading and taking over the land so hard fought for in years past by the Atherians.

The faith of the Redeemer first started in this part of the world, as it was the more underdeveloped and "backwards" part of the Atherian Empire, and as such, spread much more easily and with far less resistance than it would've received if it had started in the Atherian heartlands. It was here that after the Redeemers death, with much resistance and subjugation, the faith was able to establish itself and become recognized and surpass the faith of the Star Children, and eventually after much time converting the entire Atherian Empire to the faith of the Redeemer, with the **Sanctum Divinitatis** being established in the Kingdom of Aurelia, which become the new political/ religious and administrative centre for the western part of the Atherian Empire. However, this newly unified Atherian Empire with its faith under the church of the Redeemer was short lived, as the invasion of the Ahl-e-Ahd into the Atherians eastern part of the empire soon lead to the western part of the empire experiencing massive withdraw of resources and people, as the eastern part pulled all resources to fight off against the oncoming invasion. This lead to the western part of the empire basically falling apart, with most regions outside of the most heavily fortified cities and territories falling to bandit raids and Enaidfae raids and incursions. This carried on for a quite a long time, and eventually the Ecelssian church declaring that whoever could restore the west would be divinely mandated as the new and rightful ruler, with the church giving its blessing and authority.

The Eclessian Church claims to be the rightful successor of the Atherian legacy through divine mandate.

However, it is locked in a longstanding rivalry with the **Thalmyric Empire**, which also claims succession from the Atherians. The Thalmyric faith follows the same Redeemer’s path, yet its **Eastern Church** has diverged, adopting more mystical, contemplative practices in contrast to the Eclessian Imperium’s more structured and worldly church.

---

### **Religion: The Path of the Redeemer**

The Path of the Redeemer is the spiritual foundation of the Eclessian Church, guiding the lives of its citizens through a blend of religious doctrine, daily worship, and the veneration of saints.

#### **Core Beliefs**

1. **The Lord and the Redeemer**: The **Lord** is the supreme deity, depicted as a being of light and purity, often symbolized by the **phoenix**, a creature of resurrection and divine transformation. The Redeemer was the Lord’s mortal incarnation, sent to lead humanity away from the darkness of the **Adversary** and the **Menhir** (the old Star Children) and into the light of divine love.

2. **Saints and Miracles**: Over the centuries, the church has canonized mortals who displayed exceptional faith and performed divine miracles. These saints are intermediaries between the faithful and the Lord, often depicted with angelic, bird-like features such as wings or talon-like hands.

3. **Divine Will and Free Will**: The Eclessian Church teaches that while the **Lord’s will** governs the universe, humans have free will to choose their path. Those who align with the Lord through faith and love are rewarded, while those who succumb to the Adversary fall into darkness.

4. **Scholasticism**: Intellectual and theological study is central to the faith. Monks, theologians, and scholars study divine texts, natural philosophy, and the arts as a means of honoring the Lord. This pursuit of knowledge is similar to the **Carolingian Renaissance**, with the belief that reason and faith are deeply connected.

---

### **Worship and Practices**

- **Daily Prayer and Devotions**: Eclessians engage in prayer several times a day, often at home or in elaborately adorned churches, which feature **mosaics** and **stained glass** depicting saints, the Redeemer, and divine symbols.

- **Pilgrimages**: Pilgrimages to sacred sites, including shrines of saints or places where the Redeemer performed miracles, are acts of devotion believed to offer spiritual cleansing and divine favor.

- **Charity and Service**: The faith stresses the importance of charity, healing the sick, and protecting the weak. Service to others is seen as the highest expression of love for the Redeemer.

---

### **Political and Social Structure**

The **Church of the Redeemer** is a significant part of the Eclessia's political and social structure, with the kingdom of Aurelia and its semi autonomous duchies of Veridancia and Caldria being a theocratic government that blends religious doctrine with temporal power. The other kingdoms in the Eclessian region, whilst autonomous, make sure to consider the Churches authority as it provides essential goods and services as well as having significant sway over the general populace and the peasentry.

#### **The High Council of the Redeemer**

The **High Council** is the highest authority in the Eclessian Church, overseeing religious law, doctrine, and governance. Made up of religious leaders, it advises the ruling nobilities of all kingdoms in the region, ensuring that decisions align with the Redeemer’s teachings.

#### **Noble and Knightly Influence**

Noble families hold significant power in Eclessia and its kingdoms, and are often tied to the church through their patronage of religious institutions. Knightly orders and paladins serve as protectors of the faith, defending the faith and their kingdoms and participating in crusades against heresy or foreign threats.

---

### **Conclusion**

**Eclessia** is a vast, multifaceted region driven by faith in the Redeemer. Its heartlands provide spiritual, cultural, and military power, while its hinterlands and frontier territories add crucial economic and defensive resources. Unified by religion against outside threats, competitive inwardly, the diversity in their local customs and governance means that it would really take a very determined person to unite this region all under a single banner and bring about the second Atherian Empire.

So just in case it wasnt clear from all of this.

we essentially had a single, powerful empire that was the Atherian Empire. it started in the east, but through conquest and colonization it spread west, bringing its culture, technology and manpower. Then at some point, the Redeemer came and started traveling in the west, starting a grass roots movement that focused on his message. eventually the Redeemer would be brought to the heart of the Empire (in the east in Thalmyria) and be killed (in a similar way to Jesus), before coming back from the dead and further empowering his followers, before eventually leaving to go be with the Lord. this lead to a period of change in the Atherian Empire, as the Eclessian church started to grow, with a very strong base rapidly developing in the western parts of the empire. the eastern part was more resistant to the faith but after a years and years of persecution, eventually the Atherians fully converted and turned away from their old religion. However this new empire under the faith of the Redeemer wouldn't last very long, as very soon after the Ahl-e-Ahd started their invasion of the empire in the east. this lead to rapid withdrawal of resources and man power to fight the rising power in the east and to halt the invasion, which lead to large swarths of Eclessia under manned and under supported. this lead to roving bands of banditry and raids from the Eniadfae, which lead to the break down of the empire in the west, with local governments that used to pledge loyalty to the empire striking it off on their own in order to more effectively deal with the problems they were facing. This has lead to the current state of affairs.
