#### The Birth of the Dreamlands:
In the beginning, the Dreamlands were a vast, formless expanse of raw potential, a realm where reality and imagination intertwined. This ethereal plane was shaped by the collective subconscious of sentient beings, who, in their dreams, gave birth to landscapes, creatures, and entities beyond comprehension.

#### The First Dreams:
As the first sentient beings began to dream, their deepest desires, fears, and vices took on forms of their own within the Dreamlands. These primordial dreams were powerful and chaotic, each a reflection of the darkest aspects of the dreamers' souls. From these potent dreams, the Idols were born, each representing one of the seven deadly sins that plagued the hearts of mortals.

#### The Rise of the Idols:
1. **Avarix - Greed:** The first to emerge was Avarix, born from the insatiable hunger for wealth and power that consumed the hearts of many. He arose from the swirling mists of greed, his realm of the Hoarded Vaults forming around him, filled with unimaginable treasures and guarded by his reptilian followers.

2. **Furor - Wrath:** As the anger and rage of sentient beings manifested, Furor burst forth in a blaze of fury. His realm, the Infernal Pits, erupted with fire and lava, reflecting the endless rage that fueled his existence. His death knights, animated by the flames of his wrath, became his relentless enforcers.

3. **Lethargos - Sloth:** From the lethargy and indifference of mortals, Lethargos took shape. His realm, the Endless Mire, became a place of stagnation and stillness, where time seemed to lose meaning. His Nightmares, born of dark magic, roamed this swampy realm, spreading fear and apathy.

4. **Voracia - Gluttony:** The unending appetite and indulgence of sentient beings gave birth to Voracia. Her realm, the Eternal Feast, was a land of constant overindulgence, where the food never satisfied and the hunger never ceased. Her ghoulish followers, driven by an unending hunger, feasted on all they could find.

5. **Vaingloria - Pride:** From the arrogance and self-admiration of mortals, Vaingloria emerged. Her realm, the Shimmering Palace, was a place of grandiose beauty and isolation, filled with mirrors that reflected the vanity of those who entered. Her spectral peacocks, deadly in their pride, strutted through her palace.

6. **Luxuria - Lust:** The desires and passions of sentient beings gave rise to Luxuria. Her realm, the Garden of Temptation, was a lush paradise designed to arouse and ensnare. Her sirens, succubi, and incubi lured mortals into a cycle of endless desire and indulgence.

7. **Invidia - Envy:** Finally, from the jealousy and resentment of mortals, Invidia was born. Her realm, the Shadowed Glade, was a dark, twisted forest where nothing was ever enough. Her shades, whispering words of envy, fed off the discontent of those who entered.

#### The Rule of the Idols:
As the Idols grew in power, their influence spread throughout the Dreamlands and into the minds of mortals. They thrived on the vices they represented, drawing strength from the darkest aspects of sentient beings. Their realms became reflections of their nature, each a domain of temptation, corruption, and excess.

#### The Worship of the Idols:
Mortals, drawn to the power and promises of the Idols, began to worship them. Temples and altars were erected in their honor, and rituals were performed to invoke their favor. The Idols, in turn, granted boons and curses, manipulating mortals to further their own ends.

#### The Eternal Struggle:
The Dreamlands, shaped by the collective consciousness of sentient beings, became a battleground for the Idols. Each sought to expand their influence, vying for dominance over the dreams and desires of mortals. This eternal struggle ensured that the Idols remained ever-present, feeding on the vices that gave them life and power.

#### Legacy:
The origin of the Idols serves as a reminder of the darkness that resides within every sentient being. Their existence is a testament to the power of dreams and the influence of the subconscious, shaping the Dreamlands and the waking world alike. The Idols, born of the first dreams, continue to haunt the minds of mortals, ever-watchful, ever-hungry for more.
