### Appearance:
- **Description:** Trium is a colossal, eldritch entity embodying the essence of all three aspects. Its form constantly shifts, displaying elements of scales from Thalassor, bark and antlers from Sylvorn, and swirling clouds and lightning from Zephyraxis. Its eyes are multi-faceted, resembling stars and endless abysses, piercing through reality itself. The mere sight of Trium can drive mortals to madness, as they struggle to comprehend its otherworldly nature.

### Followers:
- **The Unified Worshippers:**
  - **Description:** A blend of all three factions (Deep Ones, Fae, and Aerials), coming together during rare celestial events to worship and receive guidance. These followers retain their individual traits but exhibit heightened abilities and a more primal, powerful form during the manifestation of Trium.
  - **Behavior:** Unified worshippers engage in coordinated rituals and ceremonies, combining their elemental powers to honor Trium. They communicate through a shared, ancient language known only to them, and their actions are synchronized, as if guided by a single mind.

### Rituals:
- **Grand Ceremonies:** These involve all elements—water, earth, and air. Followers perform intricate dances and chants, making sacrifices and offerings to ensure the balance of the world and the favor of Trium. Rituals often involve elaborate altars adorned with relics from each domain, such as coral and shells from the ocean, bones and leaves from the forest, and feathers and lightning-struck stones from the sky.
- **Mass Sacrifices:** During the Wild Hunt, prisoners taken from raids are sacrificed en masse to appease Trium and gain its blessings. These ceremonies are brutal and bloody, with rites that are said to open portals to other realms.

### Sacred Sites:
- **Convergence Points:** Locations where the three realms meet—cliffs overlooking the ocean, ancient groves with views of the sky, and deep caves that echo with the sound of the wind and waves. These sites are charged with powerful energies and are often the locations of the most potent rituals.
- **Hidden Altars:** Throughout the land, secret altars dedicated to Trium are hidden in remote and dangerous locations. These altars are used for smaller, yet still significant, rituals to honor Trium and seek its guidance.

### Manifestation and the Wild Hunt:
- **Trigger Events:** Trium can only manifest when specific terrestrial/weather events align perfectly, such as the heart of a hurricane during an earthquake that causes a tsunami. These triple threat level events happen extremely rarely, requiring precise conditions to occur.
- **The Wild Hunt:** An event where the new moon and darkness of night linger for weeks. During this time, the followers and worshippers of all three aspects become enhanced and more primal/powerful forms of themselves. The hunting party traverses the land, pillaging, raiding, and capturing humans for mass sacrifices and orgies. The Wild Hunt is a period of chaos and terror, leaving devastation in its wake.
- **Aftermath:** When the Wild Hunt ends, Trium’s influence wanes, and the aspects return to their dreaming states. The land bears the scars of the Hunt, with haunted sites and lingering eldritch energies.

### Human Worship:
- **Intermediaries:** High priests and shamans from each aspect come together to form a council that guides the worship of Trium. These individuals are deeply connected to their respective aspects and play a crucial role in the rituals.
- **Cults:** Secretive cults dedicated to Trium exist throughout the world. These cults are highly hierarchical, with the most devoted and powerful members at the top. They work in the shadows, preparing for the rare celestial events that allow Trium to manifest.
- **Symbols and Relics:** Unified symbols combining elements of all three aspects, such as a triskele with scales, antlers, and lightning bolts. Relics include ancient tomes detailing the rites of Trium, enchanted objects used in rituals, and artifacts recovered from past Wild Hunts.

### Additional Elements:
- **Legendary Artifacts:** Items like the Trident of Thalassor, Horn of Sylvorn, and Staff of Zephyraxis combine to form the Scepter of Trium, a powerful artifact capable of commanding all elements and summoning Trium’s power.
- **Eldritch Influence:** The presence of Trium and its followers can cause natural disasters, unexplained phenomena, and widespread fear. People may experience prophetic visions, madness, and strange transformations during the periods leading up to the Wild Hunt.
