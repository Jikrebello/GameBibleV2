#### Appearance:
- **Description:** Zephyraxis is a being of pure elemental fury, composed of swirling clouds and shadows, with tendrils of lightning crackling through its form. Its eyes are like distant stars, burning with a cold, detached fury that seems to pierce through the very soul of those who dare to look into them. The form of Zephyraxis is ever-changing, sometimes appearing as a massive storm cloud, other times as a ghostly figure cloaked in mist.

#### Followers:
- **The Aerials:**
  - **Description:** Formless spirits that can take on any shape they desire, often appearing as wisps of fog, shadowy figures, or beings made of pure wind. They are invisible to most, but their presence can be felt as a sudden chill or a whispering wind.
  - **Behavior:** The Aerials are mischievous and dangerous, leading travelers astray, causing sudden gusts of wind that can topple the unwary, or striking individuals with bolts of inspiration or madness. They delight in chaos and often play cruel tricks on humans.

#### Rituals:
- **Storm Rites:** Followers gather during fierce storms, calling down lightning and wind to cleanse and empower themselves. They believe that by doing so, they can absorb a fraction of Zephyraxis's power.
- **Offerings:** Precious metals and rare herbs are offered to Zephyraxis, often burned to send their essence into the sky. The smoke and fumes are believed to carry their prayers and requests to the god.
- **Sacrificial Rites:** In extreme cases, followers may offer living sacrifices during powerful storms, believing that the blood and life force of the victim will appease Zephyraxis and grant boons to the faithful.

#### Sacred Sites:
- **High Mountain Peaks:** Remote and treacherous mountains that pierce the clouds. These peaks are often struck by lightning, and the air is filled with a constant electric charge. Pilgrims who survive the ascent are said to be blessed or cursed by Zephyraxis.
- **Ancient Towers:** Ruined towers built by ancient civilizations, now crumbling and overgrown. These towers reach into the sky and are believed to be conduits for Zephyraxis's power. They are often the sites of powerful rituals and gatherings.

#### Human Worship:
- **Secretive Cults:** Human worshipers form secretive cults, often in isolated and remote locations. These cults are led by individuals who claim to have been touched or spoken to by Zephyraxis.
- **Sky-Watchers:** Worshipers often spend their lives watching the skies, interpreting the patterns of clouds and storms as messages from Zephyraxis. They believe that by understanding these patterns, they can predict the future or gain insights into the will of their god.
- **Lightning Struck:** Those who have survived being struck by lightning are considered to be chosen by Zephyraxis. They often become shamans or high priests within the cult, revered for their supposed direct connection to the god.
- **Symbols and Relics:** Cults use symbols like the lightning bolt, the eye of the storm, and swirling cloud motifs. Relics include items struck by lightning, enchanted metals, and ancient scrolls detailing the worship and rites of Zephyraxis.

#### Additional Elements:
- **Legendary Artifacts:** Items like the Staff of Zephyraxis, which can summon storms and control the winds, and the Cloak of Shadows, which grants the wearer the ability to become invisible and move like the wind.
- **Eldritch Influence:** The presence of Zephyraxis and its followers can cause strange weather patterns, sudden storms, and unexplained phenomena in the sky. People may experience hallucinations or be driven mad by the constant howling of the wind and the crackle of unseen lightning.
