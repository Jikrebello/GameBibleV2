#### Appearance:
- **Description:** Sylvorn is a towering, centaur-like figure with a humanoid upper body covered in bark-like skin and a lower body resembling that of a stag. His head is crowned with massive, twisted antlers adorned with hanging moss and glowing fungi. His eyes glow with a wild, feral green light, and his presence exudes an aura of primal power and ancient wisdom.

#### Followers:
- **The Fae:**
  - **Description:** Primal fauns, satyrs, and forest spirits. They appear enchanting and ethereal but are capricious and dangerous, often leading humans into their realm with promises of beauty and wonder, only to reveal their true, darker nature.
  - **Culture:** The Fae engage in rituals and ceremonies that are both mesmerizing and horrifying. They barter with humans using abstract things like a person's first memory of their mother, their laugh, or the name of their firstborn child. Their pranks often end in death, misery, or torture, reflecting their cruel sense of humor.

#### Domains:
- **Forests:** Sylvorn commands the wild, untamed forests, where nature reigns supreme.
- **Nature:** The raw, primal force of the natural world, unfiltered and unrestrained.
- **Primal Power:** The ancient, savage strength of the earth and its creatures.
- **Transformation:** The ability to change and mutate living beings and the landscape itself.
- **Reproduction:** The cycle of life and death, fertility, and the creation of new life through dark and eldritch means.

#### Rituals:
- **Blackest New Moon:** Followers perform rituals during the darkest nights, offering blood sacrifices to ensure bountiful harvests and protection. The blood of humans and animals alike is spilled in Sylvorn's name.
- **Ancient Stone Circles:** Rituals are held around these circles, where thick, oak-like trees with black bark and violet sap stand. The sap causes madness and visions, and the acorns are used in various rituals.
- **Mass Orgies:** These lead to the birth of children who are given up to become changelings, left in the care of the Fae.
- **Chanting in Forgotten Tongues:** The Fae chant in languages lost to time, invoking the ancient power of Sylvorn.

#### Sacred Sites:
- **Dark Forests:** Ancient woods where the trees whisper secrets and the pathways shift. These forests are alive with the presence of Sylvorn, filled with hidden dangers and eldritch beauty.
- **Hidden Groves:** Secretive places deep within the forests, only accessible to those marked by Sylvorn. These groves are filled with ancient power and are used for the most sacred and secretive rituals.
- **Underground Cities:** Enigmatic and labyrinthine, these cities shift their entrances, making them nearly impossible to find. Those who enter rarely return, and if they do, they are forever changed.

#### Human Worship:
- **Changeling Replacements:** Humans are given or abandoned at stone circles, where they are taken by the Fae and replaced with changelings. These changelings grow up to become high druids who commune with and perform rituals for Sylvorn and his followers.
- **Remote Worship:** Practiced in secret, usually in remote areas far from civilization. Worshipers seek Sylvorn's protection from natural threats, starvation, weather, and other human forces.
- **High Druids:** Changelings who have grown into their roles, performing the most powerful and secretive rituals. They are deeply connected to Sylvorn and act as intermediaries between the god and his followers.
- **Symbols and Relics:** Worshipers use symbols like the stag, antlers, and ancient runes. Relics include items made from forest materials, such as carved wooden idols, bones of forest creatures, and enchanted plants.

#### Additional Elements:
- **Legendary Artifacts:** Items like the Horn of Sylvorn, capable of controlling beasts and plants, and the Staff of Transformation, which can mutate and change anything it touches.
- **Eldritch Influence:** Sylvorn's presence warps the environment, causing plants to grow unnaturally, animals to behave strangely, and people to experience visions and madness.
