#### Appearance:
- **Description:** Thalassor is an eldritch horror of immense proportions. Its body is a grotesque amalgamation of scales, tentacles, and bioluminescent patterns that pulse with an eerie light. Its eyes are deep, endless abysses that reflect the darkest parts of the ocean, seeming to draw in the souls of those who gaze into them. The sound of its movements creates a constant, unsettling murmur, like the whispers of drowned sailors.

#### Followers:
- **The Deep Ones:** 
  - **Description:** Fish-like humanoids with webbed hands and feet, gills, and large, unblinking eyes. Their skin is slick and slimy, covered in scales that glisten in the dim light of their underwater cities.
  - **Culture:** The Deep Ones live in ancient underwater cities built from coral and stone, illuminated by a sickly green bioluminescence. These cities are labyrinthine, filled with twisting tunnels and hidden chambers. They worship Thalassor through dark rituals and ceremonies, believing that by doing so, they maintain the favor and protection of their god.

#### Rituals:
- **Dark Rites:** Conducted during the darkest nights, often on the shores of isolated islands or within underwater temples. Sacrifices include captured sailors, human babies, and other offerings.
- **Summoning:** Through chants and offerings, followers summon Thalassor seeking bountiful harvests from the sea, protection, or dark wisdom. The price is often their sanity or humanity.
- **Ceremonial Items:** Deep Ones use ancient relics, such as coral-encrusted idols, black pearls, and bones of sea creatures, in their rituals.

#### Sacred Sites:
- **Underwater Temples:** Hidden beneath the waves, accessible only to those who know the secret paths. These temples are filled with relics of immense power and danger, guarded by eldritch traps and guardians.
- **Sunken City:** The heart of Thalassor's domain, where the god slumbers in a state of perpetual dreaming. The city is a maze of cyclopean architecture, filled with the echoes of ancient horrors and the maddened whispers of Thalassor's dreams.

#### Human Worship:
- **Cult-like Practices:** Found in small, isolated fishing villages and on remote islands with minimal outside contact. Worship is secretive, involving nocturnal gatherings and whispered chants.
- **Interbreeding:** Deep Ones come to the surface to interbreed with humans, creating hybrid offspring who can eventually become full Deep Ones. These hybrids often hold positions of power within the cults, guiding the human followers in their dark worship.
- **Symbols and Relics:** Cults use symbols like the trident, tentacle motifs, and the eye of Thalassor. Relics include ancient tomes written in unknown languages, talismans made from sea creatures, and artifacts recovered from shipwrecks.

#### Additional Elements:
- **Legendary Artifacts:** Items like the Trident of Thalassor, capable of controlling the seas and summoning storms, and the Eye of Madness, a gemstone that grants visions of forbidden knowledge at the cost of the holder's sanity.
- **Eldritch Influence:** The presence of Thalassor and its followers can warp the environment, causing strange weather patterns, mysterious disappearances, and sightings of monstrous sea creatures.
