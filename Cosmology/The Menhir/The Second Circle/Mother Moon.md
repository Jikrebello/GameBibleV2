### Lunara
#### Appearance and Forms:
- **Primary Form:** Lunara appears as a tall, ethereal figure draped in flowing robes that shimmer like the night sky. Her skin is pale, almost luminescent, and her eyes are deep pools of silver light, reflecting the phases of the moon. Her hair flows like liquid moonlight, often appearing to change and shift with the lunar cycle.
- **Wolf Form:** She can transform into a gigantic, silver-furred wolf with glowing eyes. In this form, she embodies the primal and feral aspects of the moon, symbolizing her dominion over lycanthropes and skinwalkers.
- **Mist Form:** During times of transformation and chaos, Lunara can dissolve into a swirling mist, her presence felt as a chilling fog that brings fear and madness to those who encounter it.

#### Weapon of Choice:
- **Silver Chalice:** Lunara wields a silver chalice filled with an ever-changing, dark liquid. This chalice symbolizes her dominion over transformation and madness, and its contents can grant visions, drive one to madness, or bestow dark power.
- **Moon Sickles:** In battle, she wields dual crescent-shaped sickles made of silver that look like the waxing and waning crescents of the luna cycle. These weapons can sever the ties between reality and the dream world, causing confusion and terror among her enemies.

#### Personality and Characterization:
