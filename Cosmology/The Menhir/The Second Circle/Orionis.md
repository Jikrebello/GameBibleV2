#### Appearance and Forms:
- **Primary Form:** Orionis appears as a towering, muscular figure clad in rugged, weathered hunting gear. His eyes are sharp and focused, like those of a predatory animal. He carries a bow made of ancient wood and arrows fletched with feathers from legendary birds.
- **Falcon Form:** Orionis can transform into a great falcon, soaring through the skies and stars of space before diving down in a great burst that looks like a shooting star.
- **Shadow Form:** To stalk his prey unseen, Orionis can take on the form of a shadowy figure that moves silently through the forest. This form allows him to blend with the darkness and surprise his targets.

#### Personality and Characterization:
- **Master Hunter:** Orionis embodies skill, patience, and precision, as well as the thrill and energy of the hunt. He moves onto the next target as soon as the prey has been hunted, always seeking the next challenge.
- **Solitary and Mysterious:** Orionis is a solitary figure, preferring the company of the wild over that of mortals. He is mysterious and often silent, communicating through signs and omens rather than words.
- **Mentor to Hunters:** Despite his solitary nature, Orionis mentors those who venerate the hunt. However, these chosen must be careful, as the upliftment of great hunters leads to the greatest thrill for Orionis—the hunt of the hunters themselves.

#### Influence and Worship:
- **Temples and Altars:** Temples dedicated to Orionis are often located deep within forests or on high mountain peaks, where nature reigns supreme. These temples are simple and functional, adorned with hunting trophies, animal pelts, and antlers. Altars are made of stone and wood, often surrounded by offerings of crafted bows and arrows.
- **Rituals:** Worshipers of Orionis perform rituals at dawn and dusk, times when the hunt is most fruitful. These rituals involve offerings of animal pelts, antlers, and crafted bows. Hunters may also participate in ceremonial hunts, dedicating their first catch to Orionis.
- **Hunter Societies:** Many hunters form societies or guilds in honor of Orionis, sharing knowledge and skills and participating in grand hunts where tribes hunt rival tribes alongside great beasts uplifted for the great hunt.
- **Omens:** The appearance of Orionis’s shooting star is seen as a sign of mixed fortune. For hunters, it signals that their quarry is near, but it also warns that the prey might turn and hunt them instead.

#### Symbols and Relics:
- **Symbols:** The bow and arrow are the primary symbols of Orionis. These symbols are often used in tattoos, charms, and insignias by his followers.
- **Relics:** Sacred relics include enchanted bows that never miss their mark, arrows that can pierce any target, and antlers that grant protection in the wilderness. These relics are used in rituals to invoke Orionis’s power and favor.

#### Additional Elements:
- **Legendary Artifact:** The Bow of Orionis is a legendary artifact said to grant unparalleled skill in archery and the ability to track any creature, no matter how elusive. It is rumored that those who wield it can commune with the spirits of the forest and call upon them for aid, but it can also possess those who lose themselves in the hunt.
- **Eldritch Influence:** The presence of Orionis can cause strange and wondrous phenomena, such as animals behaving unusually, plants growing at an accelerated rate, and the appearance of mysterious pathways in the forest. These signs are seen as indicators of his influence and favor.
