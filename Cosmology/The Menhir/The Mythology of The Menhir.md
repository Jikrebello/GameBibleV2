### Order of Events Before the War:

1. **Creation of the First Circle:**
   - The First Circle was formed, with Father Sun (Solrath) and Mother Moon (Lunara) at the top, embodying the celestial balance of the universe.
   - The Three-Bodied God, Trium, existed in its unified state, embodying the Ocean, Land, and Sky aspects in perfect harmony.
   - The lesser star children, including Astaroth, Lyraxis, Thanatos, Orionis, Hecatara, Typhonius, and Arachnara, were yet to be born, as the First Circle maintained its celestial balance.

2. **The Golden Age:**
   - The First Circle thrived in harmony, with Father Sun and Mother Moon ruling with wisdom and power. Trium was the beloved of both, guiding the realms with its triune nature.
   - The realms of Ocean, Land, and Sky were in perfect balance, with the creatures and beings living in peace and prosperity.
   - The Four Horsemen—Solrath (Summer/War), Nevaura (Winter/Famine), Morvalis (Autumn/Death), and Veradia (Spring/Pestilence)—were initially lesser deities, maintaining the cycles of seasons and natural order.

### Leading into the Great War:

3. **The Birth of the Star Children:**
   - The lesser star children were born, bringing new dynamics and powers into the First Circle. They were weaker than their parents but held significant influence over various aspects of existence.
   - As their influence grew, so did their ambitions, leading to envy and discord within the First Circle.

4. **The Conspiracy Against Trium:**
   - A conspiracy began to form among the star children, who sought greater power and autonomy. They viewed Trium's favor with jealousy and desired to disrupt the celestial balance.
   - The star children manipulated the Four Horsemen, promising them greater power and influence in exchange for their allegiance.

5. **The Splitting of Trium:**
   - The conspirators enacted a powerful ritual that split Trium into its three aspects: Thalassor (Ocean), Sylvorn (Land), and Zephyraxis (Sky). This weakened the First Circle, causing chaos and instability.
   - The Three-Bodied God was cursed to only join briefly during specific celestial events, losing its former power and harmony.

### The Great War:

6. **The Celestial Conflict:**
   - With Trium split and the celestial balance disrupted, the realms descended into war. The Four Horsemen, now more powerful, began to assert their dominance, leading their respective factions.
   - Father Sun and Mother Moon struggled to maintain order, facing betrayal from within as the star children pursued their own ambitions.

7. **Battles of the Divine:**
   - The realms saw epic battles between the divided factions, with the Ocean, Land, and Sky now in perpetual conflict.
   - The star children, along with the Four Horsemen, fought for control and supremacy, causing widespread destruction and upheaval.

### The Aftermath of the War:

8. **The Fall of the First Circle:**
   - The war culminated in the destruction of the First Circle. Father Sun and Mother Moon were forced to retreat, weakened and unable to restore the former order.
   - The star children, realizing the devastation they had caused, sought to establish new order from the chaos.

9. **Formation of the Second, Third, and Fourth Circles:**
   - The Celestial Family (Second Circle) emerged, led by the star children who sought to rebuild and govern the realms with a new hierarchy.
   - The Three-Bodied God (Third Circle), now in its fragmented state, continued to wield influence but was no longer the unified force it once was.
   - The Four Horsemen (Fourth Circle) established their dominion, embodying the seasons and the apocalyptic forces, enforcing their will with fear and reverence.

10. **A New Era:**
	 - The Menhir entered a new era, with the Second, Third, and Fourth Circles coexisting in a fragile balance.
	- The realms, scarred by the war, adapted to the new order, with the worship of the gods marked by fear, reverence, and a deep memory of the celestial conflict.
